41590124,Breast cancer survival by stage at diagnosis in countries in transition: A population-based study.,"This study explores variation in stage-specific survival in women diagnosed with breast cancer in transitioning countries. We obtained data of women diagnosed between 2008 and 2012 from 11 population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) in 10 countries, with follow-up until December 2014. Following stage data standardization and multiple imputation for missing data, we estimated age-standardized 1-, 3-, and 5-year net survival (ASNS) by stage and age group. Stage distribution varied significantly across jurisdictions. Puerto Rico had over 4 in 5 patients diagnosed with early stage (stage I/II), while India, Trivandrum, and Thailand, Khon Kaen had <3 in 5 diagnosed with early stage. Stage-specific ASNS was similar across early stages (stage I/II) but varied markedly for stage IV, where the highest 3-year ASNS (Puerto Rico: 43.2% 95% CI: 38.9%-47.6%) was 20 percentage points higher than the lowest 3-year ASNS (India, Trivandrum: 22.8% 95% CI: 10.2%-35.4%). ASNS for patients 60 years and older was generally lower than for patients younger than 60 years across all jurisdictions. Differences in ASNS were subtle in early stages but were especially pronounced for stage IV, where in Puerto Rico, 3-year ASNS for patients younger than 60 (49.0% 95% CI: 42.7%-55.2%) was over 13 percentage points higher than 3-year ASNS for patients 60 or older (35.4% 95% CI: 29.2%-41.7%). Disparities in breast cancer survival were partly explained by differences in early diagnosis and in care at late stages. Stage at diagnosis is an important indicator that should be collected by registries worldwide, particularly for late-stage disease and older patients.",International journal of cancer,2026,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
41441997,Cost-effectiveness of contrast-enhanced mammography compared to conventional imaging in the work-up after screening (RACER trial).,"The randomised controlled clinical RACER trial studied the diagnostic work-up with contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) compared to conventional imaging as the primary tool in women recalled from breast cancer screening. This current trial-based economic evaluation was performed from a hospital perspective. Cost prices were retrieved from the financial departments of the Maastricht University Medical Centre. Health-related quality of life was measured five times over 18 months using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Cost-utility analysis outcome was expressed as costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Multiple imputation was used for missing data, and non-parametric bootstrap analysis was performed to examine uncertainty in the difference in costs and incremental costs per QALY. Post hoc subgroup analysis was performed per BI-RADS recall score. Work-up with CEM showed lower total costs of €-117 (95% CI €-254; €+22) compared to conventional imaging. Average imaging costs were significantly lower with CEM (mean difference €-130; 95% CI €-153; €-105). Mean QALY for the CEM group was 1.2034 versus 1.2137 for the control group. Bootstrap analysis showed that 95% of all simulated ICERs were in the quadrants that indicate cost-savings, although 25% of the ICERs showed a small gain in QALY and 70% a small QALY loss. The probability of CEM being cost-effective is 53% at a threshold of €10,000 to accept a QALY loss. In the subgroup of BI-RADS 0 recalls, specifically, this probability is 85%. CEM as a primary tool in the diagnostic work-up is a cost-effective diagnostic strategy, especially in BI-RADS 0 recalls. Question Diagnostic accuracy is similar with contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) compared to conventional as primary imaging. However, while the work-up is more efficient, is it also a cost-effective strategy? Findings Using CEM as primary imaging tool in the diagnostic work-up of recalls from screening results in lower costs with similar QALY compared to conventional imaging. Clinical relevance In BI-RADS- 0 (low suspicion) recalls, CEM should be used as primary imaging modality instead of conventional imaging. CEM compared to conventional imaging in the work-up of recalled women is cost-effective. In other recalls, CEM should be strongly considered.",European radiology,2025,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
41284233,"Clinical Characteristics and Prognosis of Breast Signet Ring Cell Carcinoma: A Propensity Score-Matched, Population-Based Study.","<b>Aims/Background</b> Breast signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) represents an uncommon tumour that has not been extensively studied. This investigation sought to assess the clinical characteristics and prognosis of breast SRCC and compare them with those of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). <b>Methods</b> We obtained clinicopathological data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, including 222 patients with breast SRCC and 492,559 patients with IDC. Clinical features, treatments, and survival outcomes were compared between the two groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) methodology was used to balance baseline characteristics when evaluating overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Sensitivity analyses employing E-values quantified the potential impact of unmeasured confounding, and multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) was used to address missing data for molecular subtype and histological grade. Additionally, predictive models in the form of nomograms were developed to estimate OS and CSS for patients with breast SRCC. <b>Results</b> Compared with IDC, breast SRCC was significantly associated with older age and more advanced tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) stage (<i>p</i> < 0.05 for all). Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that breast SRCC patients exhibited markedly poorer survival outcomes (OS and CSS, <i>p</i> < 0.05) compared to IDC patients before PSM. For breast SRCC, the median OS was 67.0 months and the median CSS was 90.0 months. The OS rates at 3, 5, and 8 years stood at 60.9%, 51.5%, and 39.6%, respectively, while the corresponding CSS rates were 67.7%, 59.7%, and 48.6%. Following PSM analysis, survival outcomes between breast SRCC and IDC patients became comparable (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Multivariable assessment identified age, histological grade, T stage, and surgical intervention as independent OS predictors (<i>p</i> < 0.05 for all) in breast SRCC, while histological grade, T stage, and surgical approach were independent CSS factors (<i>p</i> < 0.05 for all). The nomograms were subsequently validated using the concordance index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic (ROC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA), demonstrating robust prognostic capability. Sensitivity analysis revealed E-values of 1.35 (OS) and 1.49 (CSS), which exceeded typical confounder effects. Multiple imputation demonstrated consistent results (OS: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94-1.54; CSS: HR = 1.30, 95% CI 0.86-1.97), supporting the robustness of the findings. <b>Conclusion</b> Breast SRCC is associated with poorer outcomes primarily due to more advanced stage at presentation rather than histological type alone. Nomograms were developed to estimate OS and CSS for patients with breast SRCC.","British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)",2025,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
41194812,Prognostic Impact of De-escalation Therapy in Older Adults With Breast Cancer: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Background With global population aging, breast cancer is increasingly diagnosed in older adults, and individuals aged 70 years and above now account for over 30% of new cases. Standard treatments, including surgery, radiation, endocrine therapy, and chemotherapy, are effective in reducing recurrence and improving survival. However, older patients remain underrepresented in clinical trials, resulting in limited evidence specific to this population. In clinical practice, de-escalated adjuvant therapies are often employed in older patients, but their prognostic impact remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate recurrence outcomes according to treatment intensity in elderly breast cancer patients. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 399 breast cancer patients aged ≥70 years who underwent surgery at Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital between July 2011 and March 2023. Patients were classified as receiving either standard or de-escalated adjuvant therapy, with standard therapy defined according to the 2022 Japanese Breast Cancer Clinical Practice Guidelines. Clinical data, including comorbidities, stage, and tumor subtype, were collected. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for clinical covariates. Multiple imputation was performed to address missing data. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age, stage, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. Results The cohort included 399 patients (median age: 75 years) with a median follow-up of 56 months (interquartile range: 27-89). Only five recurrences (1.3%) were observed. In the unadjusted analysis, the median RFS was 46 months in the standard treatment group and 62 months in the de-escalation group. After adjustment with multiple imputation, the median RFS was not reached in either group. The hazard ratio for recurrence in the standard versus de-escalation group was 0.094 in the unadjusted analysis and 1.51 after adjustment. Notable differences were observed between groups with respect to comorbidities, disease stage, and tumor subtype. Conclusions De-escalated adjuvant therapy may be an appropriate option for selected elderly breast cancer patients, particularly those with favorable disease profiles. The very low recurrence rate observed in this cohort supports individualized treatment strategies that balance efficacy with tolerability. Prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings and to inform evidence-based decision-making in geriatric oncology.",Cureus,2025,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
41102597,Factors Associated With Fear of Cancer Recurrence in a Multiethnic Cohort of Patients With Breast Cancer.,"Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is prevalent among patients with breast cancer, yet those at high risk are not well characterized. This study aimed to identify the patient characteristics associated with FCR after diagnosis. Between July and September 2023, participants in the Chicago Multiethnic Epidemiologic Breast Cancer Cohort completed the 9-item FCR-Short Form Inventory. A score of 22 or higher indicated clinically significant FCR (csFCR). Logistic and linear regression estimated associations between different risk factors and csFCR and FCR scores, respectively. Missing data were addressed using multiple imputation. Among 1390 stage I-III patients (mean age 63.1 years and 9.1 [mean] years since diagnosis), 262 (18.8%) reported csFCR. In adjusted models, csFCR was associated with having another cancer excluding non-melanoma skin (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.64; 95% CI, 1.66-4.21), greater levels of stress (aOR, 2.40 per 1-SD increment; 95% CI, 1.98-2.91), having a prior recurrence (aOR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.14-4.47), and having estrogen receptor-positive tumors (aOR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.06-2.40). Older age at diagnosis (aOR, 0.64 per 10-year increment; 95% CI, 0.56-0.73) was associated with lower odds of csFCR. Similar associations were observed with continuous FCR scores, along with advanced stage at diagnosis associated with higher FCR scores (p-trend = 0.001). Nearly 1 in 5 breast cancer patients reported csFCR. Key risk factors included younger age at diagnosis, history of recurrence or other malignancies, greater levels of stress, and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, which can inform targeted interventions to support survivorship.",Psycho-oncology,2025,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
41101016,Approaches to handle missing follow-up time: A comparative analysis of contralateral breast cancer incidence.,"We aimed to compare various common approaches for handling missing vital status or follow-up time. As a case study for application of these methods, we estimated incidence of metachronous contralateral breast cancer (CBC). For 1980-2016, incidence of metachronous CBC with follow-up through 2024 was estimated using Poisson regression with overdispersion, by age at incidence, year of incidence, histology and follow-up period. Missing follow-up time was ignored in the naive approach, simulated once using the average hazard derived from published Swiss cancer registry data, or multiply imputed using 3 different imputation models. 24,612 women aged 20-84 had unilateral breast cancer between 1980 and 2016 in the Swiss cantons of Zurich and Zug. Of those, 5 % (n = 1264) were lost to follow-up. Over 291,463 person-years, 1145 contralateral breast malignancies were diagnosed, corresponding to 393 per 100,000 person-years (95 % CI 353-438). Incidence rates have been decreasing over time to 238 (171-333) for the incidence period 2010-2016. The same overall pattern was observed regardless of how we handled missing follow-up times. However, using a single imputation generally produced lower incidence rates compared to the naive approach, with multiple imputation giving higher estimates. The most complex multiple imputation model gave incidence estimates that were very similar to those from the naive approach. Different methods to handle missing follow-up times yielded similar results: that CBC incidence has declined in recent decades. Multiple imputation is likely an appropriate method to handle missing follow-up data, enabling researchers to include all eligible individuals in the analysis.",Cancer epidemiology,2025,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
40853656,Resignation in Working Women With Breast and Gynecologic Cancers.,"Diagnosis of breast and gynecologic cancers may hamper employment; little is known about who is at greater risk of resignation. To examine whether a breast or gynecologic cancer diagnosis is associated with resignation in working women and to identify high-risk subpopulations. This matched cohort study included women aged 15 to 58 years insured by the Japan Health Insurance Association. From April 2017 to March 2023, women newly diagnosed with breast, cervical, uterine, or ovarian cancer were identified and matched in a 1:10 ratio to working women without these cancers. Cancer diagnosis was based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). The primary outcome was all-cause resignation, and the secondary outcome was a composite of resignation and death, both assessed during a 2-year follow-up. Stratified Cox proportional-hazards models were applied, with multiple imputation and covariate adjustments. Subgroup analyses by prespecified covariates assessed effect size moderation and interactions between exposure and these covariates. The study included 99 964 women with cancer, including 59 452 women with breast cancer (median [IQR] age, 48 [44-53] years), 14 713 women with cervical cancer (median [IQR] age, 46 [39-51] years), 16 933 women with uterine cancer (median [IQR] age, 49 [44-53 years]), and 8866 women with ovarian cancer (median age [IQR] age, 47 [40-52] years), as well as 999 640 matched controls (594 520 for the breast cancer cohort, 147 130 for the cervical cancer cohort, 169 330 for the uterine cancer cohort, and 88 660 for the ovarian cancer cohort). Most women with cancer were working in the medical, health care, or welfare sector (32 123 women [32.1%]). During follow-up, resignation rates were significantly higher for women with cancer vs controls (breast cancer: 10 820 women [18.2%] vs 97 892 women [16.5%]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.16-1.20; cervical cancer: 3296 women [22.4%] vs 27 476 women [18.7%]; HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.26-1.36; uterine cancer: 3161 women [18.7%] vs 27 786 women [16.4%]; HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.19-1.29; ovarian cancer: 2004 women [22.6%] vs 15 847 women [17.9%]; HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.37-1.51). Regarding the composite outcome of resignation and death, there was an increased risk for all cohorts, ranging from an HR of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.22-1.27) for breast cancer to 1.81 (95% CI, 1.73-1.89) for ovarian cancer. Among all 4 cancer cohorts, resignation risk was higher among women with older age, lower income, and a history of depression. In this cohort study using a nationwide health claims database in Japan, breast and gynecologic cancers were associated with a higher resignation risk, especially among those with older age, lower income, and depression history. These findings suggest that developing targeted support interventions may benefit women at high resignation risk after a cancer diagnosis.",JAMA network open,2025,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
40681529,Breast cancer survival and mortality among women with type 2 diabetes: a retrospective cohort study.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is estimated to affect over 200 million women globally and over 2 million women are estimated to be diagnosed with breast cancer each year. This study aimed to determine the association between breast cancer molecular subtypes and survival in a cohort of women with T2DM. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using linked Scottish population-based data for 3,042 women diagnosed with T2DM prior to their diagnosis of invasive breast cancer between 2010 and 2019 that had complete data available. The women in the cohort were aged 50 to 84 years at the time of breast cancer diagnosis. Univariate analyses were performed using non-parametric ten-year Kaplan Meier (KM) estimates for breast cancer survival by molecular subtype. Hazard ratios (HR) for breast cancer mortality within three years were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for age at breast cancer diagnosis, year of diagnosis, Scottish region, mode of detection, treatment, area-based socioeconomic status, and T2DM duration were conducted. Multiple imputation was performed as a sensitivity analysis. The distribution of molecular subtype based on St Gallen's criteria was luminal A (58%), luminal B (HER2-) (19.2%), triple negative (9.9%), luminal B (HER2 +) (8.5%), and HER2-enriched (4.4%). There were 286 breast cancer deaths in total within three years. KM estimates showed women with HER2-enriched tumours had the worst survival at ages 50 to 69, while those with triple-negative tumours had the worst survival at ages 70 to 84. Adjusted HRs (95% confidence intervals) for mortality over 3 years compared to luminal A were 2.04 (1.43, 2.90) for luminal B (HER2-), 5.68 (3.40, 9.50) for triple negative, 2.22 (1.46, 3.38) for luminal B (HER2 +), and 2.93 (1.63, 5.27) for HER2-enriched. The imputed cohort adjusted HRs were attenuated, particularly for HER2-enriched (HR = 1.71 (1.01, 2.89)) and triple negative (HR = 2.74 (1.72, 4.37)). Like the general population, triple negative and HER2-enriched tumors had worse prognosis compared to luminal A tumors and their association with breast cancer mortality are similar in women with type 2 diabetes and the general population. However, our findings revealed differences in the survival ranking of HER2-enriched and triple-negative subtypes for breast cancer diagnosed in the 50-69 age group between women with type 2 diabetes and the general population, warranting further exploration.",Scientific reports,2025,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
40541467,"Disparities in Access to Multigene Testing in Early-Stage, HR-positive, HER2-negative, Lymph Node-negative Breast Cancer.","Multigene testing (MGT) has refined breast cancer treatment. We examined real-world access to MGT for early-stage (I-II), HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative breast cancer and identified factors related to disparities. This retrospective analysis used the National Cancer Database (2007-2017). Socio-demographic and clinical-pathologic factors of interest were included in a multivariable logistic regression to examine associations with MGT use. Multiple imputation was used to find missing data. A total of N = 107,642 patients were eligible, of which 65,066 (60%) underwent MGT. The odds of undergoing MGT were lower among Black patients compared to White (OR 0.83, 95% CI, 0.79-0.87, P < .001), Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic (OR 0.91, 95% CI, 0.86-0.97, P = .004), uninsured compared to privately insured (OR 0.73,95% CI, 0.64-0.83, P < .001), and those in the West South-Central compared to New England region (OR 0.76, 95% CI, 0.70-0.82, P < .001). Increased odds were observed among those treated at an Integrated Network Cancer Program (OR 1.12, 95% CI, 1.05-1.19, P < .001), higher education level (OR 1.12, 95% CI, 1.06-1.18, P < .001), and a household income between $50,354 to $63,332 (OR 1.08, 95% CI, 1.02-1.14, P = .006). Those with access to MGT had higher odds of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (OR 1.89,95% CI, 1.80-1.99, P < .001) and hormonal therapy (OR 3.17, 95% CI, 3.02-3.32, P < .001) compared to those without access to MGT after adjusting for other factors of interest. This study highlights gaps in access to MGT in breast cancer. Ensuring equitable access to diagnostic and prognostic precision tools could positively impact the odds of receiving appropriate adjuvant therapy and improve patient outcomes.",Clinical breast cancer,2025,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
40159245,Correlation analysis of invasive disease-free survival and overall survival in a real-world population of patients with HR+/HER2- early breast cancer.,"Overall survival (OS) is the gold standard for assessing clinical benefit in oncology but requires extended follow-up to detect sufficient events. Invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) requires shorter follow-up times and is considered an objective and clinically meaningful end point in early breast cancer (EBC) trials. The authors assessed iDFS as a surrogate end point for OS in adjuvant HR+/HER2- EBC using real-world patient-level data. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patient data from the ConcertAI Patient360 database (January 1995-April 2021). Key inclusion criteria: age ≥18 years, stage II or III (AJCC 8th Edition) HR+/HER2- EBC, prior surgery, adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET). Spearman ρ, iterative multiple imputation ρ (IMI; 0.8-1 considered ""very strong""), and R<sup>2</sup> (clinical relevance R<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.70) were used to assess iDFS-OS relationship. Subgroup analyses included ET (nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen), stage, menopausal status, nodal status, prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, and prior radiotherapy. A total of 3133 patients were included (1103 [35.2%] iDFS events; 554 [17.7%] OS events); mean age was 58.4 years, 98.8% were female, 29.9% were premenopausal, and 80.9% had stage II disease. Median follow-up time was 55.1 months. iDFS and OS exhibited a positive, very strong, clinically relevant correlation (Spearman ρ: 0.88 [0.87-0.89]; IMI ρ: 0.83 [0.79-0.86]; both p < .0001). iDFS accounted for 82% of variation in OS (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.82). Results of all subgroup analyses were consistent with overall population. This patient-level real-world analysis demonstrated very strong, positive correlations between iDFS and OS, supporting the use of iDFS as a reliable primary end point in adjuvant HR+/HER2- EBC.",Cancer,2025,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
40000583,The Role of Physical Activity on Quality of Life Among Breast Cancer Survivors in the Black Women's Health Study.,"Black breast cancer survivors (BCS) are more likely to experience poor quality of life (QoL) compared to White BCS. Physical activity (PA) has been shown to improve QoL in cancer survivors. However, there is limited evidence demonstrating associations between PA and multiple QoL domains among Black BCS. This study examined the association between PA duration and intensity level (e.g., ≥ 150 min/week of moderate activity) and multiple QoL domains (e.g., physical health) among BCS in the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS). A total of 904 BWHS participants were eligible to participate in this study. The 2019 BWHS follow questionnaire, which assessed multiple QoL domains was used to address the primary aim. Adjusted multinomial logistic regression models were fit to estimate the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the associations with each exposure variable (PA) and outcome variable (QoL). Multiple imputation was used to address missing data. The average participant age was 66, and the average body mass index was 29 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at the time of QoL assessment. There were significant and positive associations between PA duration and intensity level and multiple domains of QoL (p < 0.05). Participants who engaged in higher durations of moderate PA (e.g., ≥ 150 minutes/week) had increased odds of optimal social functioning (aOR = 2.67; 95% CI 1.40, 5.08) and functional wellbeing (aOR = 4.10; 95% CI 1.71, 9.83) than those who engaged in lower durations of moderate PA (e.g., < 150 minutes/week). Compared to participants who engaged in lower durations of vigorous PA (e.g., < 60 minutes/week), those who engaged in higher durations of vigorous PA (e.g., ≥ 60 minutes/week) had greater odds of optimal physical health (aOR = 4.27; 95% CI 2.04, 8.90), social functioning (aOR = 4.48; 95% CI 2.27, 8.86), and financial wellbeing (aOR = 1.64; 95% CI 1.03, 2.63). Black BCS who engage in higher durations of moderate and vigorous PA tend to have better QoL. These findings may help to build upon the importance of PA and the relevance of PA in the context of supportive care for racial and ethnic minority BCS. Future longitudinal studies are needed to establish clear temporal associations between PA and QoL in this group.",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,2025,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
39861973,Socio-economic inequalities in second primary cancer incidence: A competing risks analysis of women with breast cancer in England between 2000 and 2018.,"We aimed to investigate socio-economic inequalities in second primary cancer (SPC) incidence among breast cancer survivors. Using Data from cancer registries in England, we included all women diagnosed with a first primary breast cancer (PBC) between 2000 and 2018 and aged between 18 and 99 years and followed them up from 6 months after the PBC diagnosis until a SPC event, death, or right censoring, whichever came first. We used flexible parametric survival models adjusting for age and year of PBC diagnosis, ethnicity, PBC tumour stage, comorbidity, and PBC treatments to model the cause-specific hazards of SPC incidence and death according to income deprivation, and then estimated standardised cumulative incidences of SPC by deprivation, taking death as the competing event. Multiple imputation was performed to account for missing data. Among 649,905 included women, 47,399 SPCs and 171,223 deaths occurred during 4,269,042 person-years of follow-up. Income deprivation was consistently associated with an increased rate of SPC incidence (cause-specific hazard ratio for the most vs. least deprived quintile: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.25, 1.33) and of death (1.36; 1.34, 1.38), translating into an absolute risk difference (the most vs. least deprived quintile) of 1.3% (95% CI: 1.0, 1.5) for SPC incidence and 4.9% (95% CI: 4.6, 5.1) for death at 10 years. Women with PBC from deprived areas in England faced a substantially higher risk of SPC than their counterparts. Future research is warranted to understand mechanisms for observed inequalities to inform strategies to monitor, prevent, and identify SPC in women with PBC.",International journal of cancer,2025,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
39581012,Trends in incidence and survival of the four most common cancers by stage at diagnosis in Cyprus: A population-based study from 2004 to 2017.,"Breast, colorectal, lung and prostate cancers are the most frequent malignancies in Cyprus. This study estimated the incidence rate and 5-year net survival (NS) trends for these cancers, by sex, age, and tumor stage at diagnosis. We analyzed data from the Cyprus Cancer Registry for adults diagnosed between 2004 and 2017, with follow-up until 2019. Tumor stage was classified into localized, regional, distant and unknown categories. We estimated the annual percentage change (APC) in incidence rates using Joinpoint regression. NS was estimated using flexible parametric models, adjusting for sex, age, stage and period of diagnosis. Multiple imputation was used to address unknown cancer stage. During 2004-2017, the incidence significantly increased for breast and lung cancer (APC: 1.1 % and 2.6 %, respectively), mainly among the elderly (70 +). A decreasing trend was identified for prostate cancer only among individuals aged 80 +. No temporal variations were identified for colorectal cancer incidence. A positive time trend was identified for localized breast cancer between 2006 and 2017 (APC: 2.8 %). Conversely, a significant increase was noted at more advanced stages for lung (APC<sub>distant</sub>: 4.1 %) and prostate (APC<sub>regional</sub>: 7.6 %) cancers. NS improved for all cancers, ranging between 80 % and 90 % for regional and all stages of breast cancer, localized colorectal cancer, and all stages of prostate cancer, surpassing 95 % for localized breast cancer, localized and regional prostate cancer. The study observed increased (breast and lung) or stable (colorectal and prostate) cancer incidence and substantial improvements in 5-years NS trends for all cancer types, despite differences by sex and stage.

This study aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness and reliability of different machine learning (ML) imputation methods across various analytical perspectives. Specifically, it focused on three distinct classes of performance metrics used to evaluate ML imputation methods: post-imputation bias of regression estimates, post-imputation predictive accuracy, and substantive model-free metrics. As an illustration, we applied data from a real-world breast cancer survival study. This comprehensive approach aimed to provide a thorough assessment of the effectiveness and reliability of ML imputation methods across various analytical perspectives. A simulated dataset with 30% Missing At Random (MAR) values was used. A number of single imputation (SI) methods - specifically KNN, missMDA, CART, missForest, missRanger, missCforest - and multiple imputation (MI) methods - specifically miceCART and miceRF - were evaluated. The performance metrics used were Gower's distance, estimation bias, empirical standard error, coverage rate, length of confidence interval, predictive accuracy, proportion of falsely classified (PFC), normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), AUC, and C-index scores. The analysis revealed that in terms of Gower's distance, CART and missForest were the most accurate, while missMDA and CART excelled for binary covariates; missForest and miceCART were superior for continuous covariates. When assessing bias and accuracy in regression estimates, miceCART and miceRF exhibited the least bias. Overall, the various imputation methods demonstrated greater efficiency than complete-case analysis (CCA), with MICE methods providing optimal confidence interval coverage. In terms of predictive accuracy for Cox models, missMDA and missForest had superior AUC and C-index scores. Despite offering better predictive accuracy, the study found that SI methods introduced more bias into the regression coefficients compared to MI methods. This study underlines the importance of selecting appropriate imputation methods based on study goals and data types in time-to-event research. The varying effectiveness of methods across the different performance metrics studied highlights the value of using advanced machine learning algorithms within a multiple imputation framework to enhance research integrity and the robustness of findings.",BMC medical research methodology,2024,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
39164739,Association between remnant cholesterol and the risk of 4 site-specific cancers: evidence from a cross-sectional and Mendelian randomization study.,"Recent studies have implicated remnant cholesterol (RC) in the etiology, progression, and prognosis of cancer. However, very few of them concentrated on the study of the precise relationship between serum RC levels and cancer risk, leaving this subject unexplored. Consequently, this study aims to investigate the association between serum RC levels and 4 site-specific cancers, employing a dual approach that combines observational and mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2020, this study collected data from18,067 participants. To rule out confounders, this study utilized weighted multivariable logistic regression and assessed non-linear associations using restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression, followed by two-piecewise linear regression. Sensitivity analysis conducted in this study included subgroup analysis, multiple imputation, outlier removal, and propensity score matching. To strengthen causal inference, this study employed univariable and multivariable MR analysis. The robustness and reliability of the findings were estimated by the application of replication and meta-analysis. The results of multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between serum RC levels and breast cancer, showing that individuals in the higher logRC category had a higher risk of breast cancer compared to those in the lower category (Q3 vs. Q1: OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.01-2.88, P = 0.044). Weighted RCS revealed an inverted L-shape association between RC and the risk of breast cancer (P-nonlinear = 0.0386, P-overall = 0.010). Primary MR analysis provided evidence for an increased risk of breast (IVW: OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.03-1.12, P = 0.000951) and colorectal cancer (IVW: OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00-1.24, P = 0.0476) associated with RC. However, the results of replication and meta-analysis did not support a significant causal association of RC with the risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.95-1.13), lung cancer (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.88-1.03), colorectal cancer (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.92-1.19), and prostate cancer (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.95-1.08). Although a non-linear relationship was observed in the cross-sectional study between remnant cholesterol levels and breast cancer risk, MR analyses failed to provide any causal evidence.",Lipids in health and disease,2024,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
39098454,A bio-behavioral model of systemic inflammation at breast cancer diagnosis and fatigue of clinical importance 2 years later.,"We aimed to generate a model of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) of clinical importance 2 years after diagnosis of breast cancer building on clinical and behavioral factors and integrating pre-treatment markers of systemic inflammation. Women with stage I-III hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer were included from the multimodal, prospective CANTO cohort (NCT01993498). The primary outcome was global CRF of clinical importance [European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 ≥40/100] 2 years after diagnosis (year 2). Secondary outcomes included physical, emotional, and cognitive CRF (EORTC QLQ-FA12). All pre-treatment candidate variables were assessed at diagnosis, including inflammatory markers [interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon γ, IL-1 receptor antagonist, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein], and were tested in multivariable logistic regression models implementing multiple imputation and validation by 100-fold bootstrap resampling. Among 1208 patients, 415 (34.4%) reported global CRF of clinical importance at year 2. High pre-treatment levels of IL-6 (quartile 4 versus 1) were associated with global CRF at year 2 [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40-3.03); P = 0.0002; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.74]. Patients with high pre-treatment IL-6 had unhealthier behaviors, including being frequently either overweight or obese [62.4%; mean body mass index 28.0 (standard deviation 6.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)] and physically inactive (53.5% did not meet World Health Organization recommendations). Clinical and behavioral associations with CRF at year 2 included pre-treatment CRF [aOR versus no pre-treatment CRF: 3.99 (95% CI 2.81-5.66)], younger age [aOR per 1-year decrement: 1.02 (95% CI 1.01-1.03)], current tobacco smoking [aOR versus never: 1.81 (95% CI 1.26-2.58)], and worse insomnia or pain [aOR per 10-unit increment: 1.08 (95% CI 1.04-1.13), and 1.12 (95% CI 1.04-1.21), respectively]. Secondary analyses indicated additional associations of IL-2 [aOR per log-unit increment: 1.32 (95% CI 1.03-1.70)] and IL-10 [0.73 (95% CI 0.57-0.93)] with global CRF and of C-reactive protein [1.42 (95% CI 1.13-1.78)] with cognitive CRF at year 2. Emotional distress was consistently associated with physical, emotional, and cognitive CRF. This study proposes a bio-behavioral framework linking pre-treatment systemic inflammation with CRF of clinical importance 2 years later among a large prospective sample of survivors of breast cancer.",Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,2024,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
38612962,The Vitamin D Receptor as a Prognostic Marker in Breast Cancer-A Cohort Study.,"Previous research has indicated an association between the presence of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in breast cancer tissue and a favorable prognosis. This study aimed to further evaluate the prognostic potential of VDR located in the nuclear membrane or nucleus (liganded). The VDR protein levels were analyzed using immunohistochemistry in tumor samples from 878 breast cancer patients from Lund, Sweden, included in the Breast Cancer and Blood Study (BCBlood) from October 2002 to June 2012. The follow-up for breast cancer events and overall survival was recorded until 30 June 2019. Univariable and multivariable survival analyses were conducted, both with complete case data and with missing data imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE). Tumor-specific positive nuclear membrane VDR<sup>(num)</sup> staining was associated with favorable tumor characteristics and a longer breast cancer free interval (BCFI; HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.44-0.95) and overall survival (OS; HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.34-0.78). Further analyses indicated that VDR<sup>num</sup> status also was predictive of overall survival when investigated in relation to ER status. There were significant interactions between VDR and invasive tumor size (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.047), as well as mode of detection (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.049). VDR<sup>num</sup> was associated with a longer BCFI in patients with larger tumors (HR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.14-0.93) or clinically detected tumors (HR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.09-0.83), while no association was found for smaller tumors and screening-detected tumors. Further studies are suggested to confirm our results and to evaluate whether VDR should and could be used as a prognostic and targetable marker in breast cancer diagnostics.",Nutrients,2024,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
38591189,Creating a Multiply Imputed Value Set for the EQ-5D-5L in Canada: State-Level Misspecification Terms Are Needed to Characterize Parameter Uncertainty Correctly.,"Parameter uncertainty in EQ-5D-5L value sets often exceeds the instrument's minimum important difference, yet this is routinely ignored. Multiple imputation (MI) accounts for parameter uncertainty in the value set; however, no valuation study has implemented this methodology. Our objective was to create a Canadian MI value set for the EQ-5D-5L, thus enabling users to account for parameter uncertainty in the value set. Using the Canadian EQ-5D-5L valuation study (<i>N</i> = 1,073), we first refit the original model followed by models with state-level misspecification. Models were compared based on the adequacy of 95% credible interval (CrI) coverage for out-of-sample predictions. Using the best-fitting model, we took 100 draws from the posterior distribution to create 100 imputed value sets. We examined how much the standard error of the estimated mean health utilities increased after accounting for parameter uncertainty in the value set by using the MI and original value sets to score 2 data sets: 1) a sample of 1,208 individuals from the Canadian general public and 2) a sample of 401 women with breast cancer. The selected model with state-level misspecification outperformed the original model (95% CrI coverage: 94.2% v. 11.6%). We observed wider standard errors for the estimated mean utilities on using the MI value set for both the Canadian general public (MI: 0.0091; original: 0.0035) and patients with breast cancer (MI: 0.0169; original: 0.0066). We provide 1) the first MI value sets for the EQ-5D-5L and 2) code to construct MI value sets while accounting for state-level model misspecification. Our study suggests that ignoring parameter uncertainty in value sets leads to falsely narrow SEs. Value sets for health state utility instruments are estimated subject to parameter uncertainty; this parameter uncertainty may exceed the minimum important difference of the instrument, yet it is not fully captured using current methods.This study creates the first multiply imputed value set for a multiattribute utility instrument, the EQ-5D-5L, to fully capture this parameter uncertainty.We apply the multiply imputed value set to 2 data sets from 1) the Canadian general public and 2) women with invasive breast cancer.Scoring the EQ-5D-5L using a multiply imputed value set led to wider standard error estimates, suggesting that the current practice of ignoring parameter uncertainty in the value set leads to falsely low standard errors.Our work will be of interest to methodologists and developers of the EQ-5D-5L and users of the EQ-5D-5L, such as health economists, researchers, and policy makers.",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,2024,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
38426821,Predicting absolute risk for a person with missing risk factors.,"We compared methods to project absolute risk, the probability of experiencing the outcome of interest in a given projection interval accommodating competing risks, for a person from the target population with missing predictors. Without missing data, a perfectly calibrated model gives unbiased absolute risk estimates in a new target population, even if the predictor distribution differs from the training data. However, if predictors are missing in target population members, a reference dataset with complete data is needed to impute them and to estimate absolute risk, conditional only on the observed predictors. If the predictor distributions of the reference data and the target population differ, this approach yields biased estimates. We compared the bias and mean squared error of absolute risk predictions for seven methods that assume predictors are missing at random (MAR). Some methods imputed individual missing predictors, others imputed linear predictor combinations (risk scores). Simulations were based on real breast cancer predictor distributions and outcome data. We also analyzed a real breast cancer dataset. The largest bias for all methods resulted from different predictor distributions of the reference and target populations. No method was unbiased in this situation. Surprisingly, violating the MAR assumption did not induce severe biases. Most multiple imputation methods performed similarly and were less biased (but more variable) than a method that used a single expected risk score. Our work shows the importance of selecting predictor reference datasets similar to the target population to reduce bias of absolute risk predictions with missing risk factors.",Statistical methods in medical research,2024,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
38419011,Prevalence of loneliness and associations with health behaviours and body mass index in 5835 people living with and beyond cancer: a cross-sectional study.,"A cancer diagnosis and its treatment may be an especially isolating experience. Despite evidence that positive health behaviours can improve outcomes for people living with and beyond cancer (LWBC), no studies have examined associations between loneliness and different health behaviours in this population. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of loneliness in a large sample of UK adults LWBC and to explore whether loneliness was associated with multiple health behaviours. Participants were adults (aged ≥ 18 years) diagnosed with breast, prostate or colorectal cancer who completed the Health and Lifestyle After Cancer Survey. Loneliness was reported using the UCLA loneliness score, dichotomised into higher (≥ 6) versus lower (< 6) loneliness. Engagement in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, dietary intake, smoking status, alcohol use, and self-reported height and weight were recorded. Behaviours were coded to reflect meeting or not meeting the World Cancer Research Fund recommendations for people LWBC. Logistic regression analyses explored associations between loneliness and health behaviours. Covariates were age, sex, ethnicity, education, marital status, living situation, cancer type, spread and treatment, time since treatment, time since diagnosis and number of comorbid conditions. Multiple imputation was used to account for missing data. 5835 participants, mean age 67.4 (standard deviation = 11.8) years, completed the survey. 56% were female (n = 3266) and 44% (n = 2553) male, and 48% (n = 2786) were living with or beyond breast cancer, 32% (n = 1839) prostate, and 21% (n = 1210) colorectal. Of 5485 who completed the loneliness scale, 81% (n = 4423) of participants reported lower and 19% (n = 1035) higher loneliness. After adjustment for confounders, those reporting higher levels of loneliness had lower odds of meeting the WCRF recommendations for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.78, 95% Confidence Internal [CI], 0.67, 0.97, p =.028), fruit and vegetable intake (OR 0.81, CI 0.67, 1.00, p =.046), and smoking (OR 0.62, 0.46, 0.84, p =.003). No association was observed between loneliness and the other dietary behaviours, alcohol, or body mass index. Loneliness is relatively common in people LWBC and may represent an unmet need. People LWBC who experience higher levels of loneliness may need additional support to improve their health behaviours.",BMC public health,2024,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
37694965,Risk factors for the increasing incidence of pregnancy-associated cancer in Sweden - a population-based study.,"The incidence of cancer during pregnancy and within first year post-delivery, ie pregnancy-associated cancer (PAC), is increasing in many countries, but little is known about risk factors for these trends. This study quantified incidence of PAC by trimesters and post-delivery periods, and assessed the role of maternal age, parity, immigrant status, education, smoking and body mass index for the risk and incidence trends of PAC. We used data from the national birth and cancer registers in Sweden during 1973-2017 to define a register-based cohort of women aged 15-44 years. Incidence rates of PAC during pregnancy and up to 1 year post-delivery were calculated per 100 000 deliveries per year. Poisson regression with multiple imputation estimated incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals adjusted by year, age, previous parity, immigrant status, education, smoking and BMI during 1990-2017, when information on risk factors was available. Among 4 557 284 deliveries, a total of 1274 (during pregnancy) and 3355 (within 1 year post-delivery) cases of PAC were diagnosed, with around 50 cases/year diagnosed during pregnancy and 110 cases/year during the first year post-delivery in the latest period 2015-2017. The most common cancer types during pregnancy were malignant melanoma, breast and cervical cancer, together accounting for 57% of cases during pregnancy and 53% during the first year post-delivery. The numbers of PAC were lower during pregnancy than during post-delivery for all tumor types with lowest numbers during first trimester. The PAC incidence rates increased over calendar time. High maternal age at diagnosis, smoking, nulliparity and non-immigrant background were associated with significantly higher risks of PAC. The increasing PAC incidence was in part explained by higher maternal age over time, but not by the other factors. High maternal age is the strongest risk factor for PAC. We show for the first time that smoking, nulliparity and non-immigrant background are also contributing risk factors for PAC. However, only high maternal age contributed significantly to the increasing incidence. Further studies on other potential risk factors for PAC are warranted, since our results indicate that age on its own does not fully explain the increase.",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,2024,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
37517504,Information about missing patient-reported outcome data in breast cancer trials is frequently not documented: a scoping review.,"This review addresses the common problem of missing patient-reported outcome (PRO) data in clinical trials by assessing the current practice of their statistical handling as reported in publications of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with breast cancer. We searched PubMed to identify RCTs evaluating biomedical treatments in breast cancer patients with at least one PRO endpoint published between January 2019 and February 2022. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the publications for this scoping review and extracted prespecified information on missing PRO data and related statistical practices. Of 1,598 publications identified, 118 trials met the inclusion criteria. Eighty-eight (74.6%) trials reported the extent of missing data, with 11 (9.3%) not containing any missing PRO data. Twenty-one (19.6%) trials explicitly stated the statistical approach for handling missing data, with a preference for single imputation over multiple imputation approaches (57.2%/19.0%). Only six (5.6%) trials reported a sensitivity analysis to examine the extent to the results being affected by changes in assumptions made about missing PRO data. International efforts to raise awareness of the importance of accurately reporting state-of-the-art handling of missing PRO data are not yet fully reflected in the current literature of breast cancer RCTs.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,2023,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"

Cruciferous vegetable intake has been associated with higher urinary 2:16 in some studies. We investigated whether a whole-food supplement made from dried Brussels sprouts and kale would increase urinary 2:16 in comparison with placebo or cruciferous vegetables in women. This randomized, parallel arm, placebo-controlled, partly blinded study included 78 healthy premenopausal women (38-50 y) with screening urinary 2:16 ≤3.0. Subjects received either six capsules containing 550 mg dried Brussels sprouts and kale per capsule, 40 g daily alternating broccoli or Brussels sprouts, or placebo for eight weeks. Urinary 2:16 and creatinine were measured at baseline, four, and eight weeks. Intent-to-treat repeated measures-ANOVA with multiple imputation (<i>n</i>=100) for missing values identified no treatment effect (<i>P</i>=0.9) or treatment-by-time interaction (<i>P</i>=0.6); however, a significant time effect was noted (<i>P</i>=0.02). Per-protocol analyses including complete cases found no treatment effect (<i>P</i>=1) or treatment-by-time interaction (<i>P</i>=0.6); however, the significant time effect remained (<i>P</i>=0.03). Restricting analysis to subjects with >80% compliance maintained the time effect (<i>P</i>=0.02). Using Pearson correlations, android-pattern and android:gynoid fat were predictive of change (<i>P</i>≤0.05). In conclusion, neither cruciferous supplements nor an added vegetable serving altered urinary 2:16 in premenopausal women with eight weeks treatment.

37220893,Target trial emulation to assess real-world efficacy in the Epidemiological Strategy and Medical Economics metastatic breast cancer cohort.,"Real-world data studies usually consider biases related to measured confounders. We emulate a target trial implementing study design principles of randomized trials to observational studies; controlling biases related to selection, especially immortal time; and measured confounders. This comprehensive analysis emulating a randomized clinical trial compared overall survival in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC), receiving as first-line treatment, either paclitaxel alone or combined to bevacizumab. We used data from 5538 patients extracted from the Epidemiological Strategy and Medical Economics-MBC cohort to emulate a target trial using advanced statistical adjustment techniques including stabilized inverse-probability weighting and G-computation, dealing with missing data with multiple imputation, and performing a quantitative bias analysis for residual bias due to unmeasured confounders. Emulation led to 3211 eligible patients, and overall survival estimates achieved with advanced statistical methods favored the combination therapy. Real-world effect sizes were close to that assessed in the existing E2100 randomized clinical trial (hazard ratio = 0.88, P = .16), but the increased sample size allowed to achieve a higher level of precision in real-world estimates (ie, reduced confidence intervals). Quantitative bias analysis confirmed the robustness of the results with respect to potential unmeasured confounding. Target trial emulation with advanced statistical adjustment techniques is a promising approach to investigate long-term impact of innovative therapies in the French Epidemiological Strategy and Medical Economics-MBC cohort while minimizing biases and provides opportunities for comparative efficacy through the synthetic control arms provided. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT03275311.",Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2023,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
37158167,Tailoring capture-recapture methods to estimate registry-based case counts based on error-prone diagnostic signals.,"Surveillance research is of great importance for effective and efficient epidemiological monitoring of case counts and disease prevalence. Taking specific motivation from ongoing efforts to identify recurrent cases based on the Georgia Cancer Registry, we extend recently proposed ""anchor stream"" sampling design and estimation methodology. Our approach offers a more efficient and defensible alternative to traditional capture-recapture (CRC) methods by leveraging a relatively small random sample of participants whose recurrence status is obtained through a principled application of medical records abstraction. This sample is combined with one or more existing signaling data streams, which may yield data based on arbitrarily non-representative subsets of the full registry population. The key extension developed here accounts for the common problem of false positive or negative diagnostic signals from the existing data stream(s). In particular, we show that the design only requires documentation of positive signals in these non-anchor surveillance streams, and permits valid estimation of the true case count based on an estimable positive predictive value (PPV) parameter. We borrow ideas from the multiple imputation paradigm to provide accompanying standard errors, and develop an adapted Bayesian credible interval approach that yields favorable frequentist coverage properties. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed methods through simulation studies, and provide a data example targeting estimation of the breast cancer recurrence case count among Metro Atlanta area patients from the Georgia Cancer Registry-based Cancer Recurrence Information and Surveillance Program (CRISP) database.",Statistics in medicine,2023,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"

In a population-based cross-sectional study, information on two health literacy subscales, measured using the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ), and sociodemographic factors was obtained from the 'How are you? 2017' survey in the Central Denmark Region. Information on screening attendance was obtained from register data from 2016-2017. Data were linked based on individual civil registration numbers. To account for missing data, multiple imputation by chained equations was implemented to fill in missing values on all variables. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed separately for two HLQ subscales to estimate odds ratio (OR) of screening attendance. Both multiple imputation analyses and complete case analyses were performed. A total of 6012 women were included in multiple imputed statistical analyses. Generally, women had high health literacy levels. In multiple imputed analyses, the unadjusted OR of the primary HLQ subscale, understanding, was 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.59), indicating higher odds for screening attendance with higher health literacy level. However, after adjustment no significant association between the HLQ subscale of understanding and screening attendance was found (OR 1.09 (95% CI: 0.90-1.33)). Similar results were found for the secondary HLQ subscale of engaging (insignificant association in adjusted analysis). No effect modification from sociodemographic characteristics was found.

Multicenter cross-sectional study (10 US hospitals) in women (n = 1206) with primary diagnosis of invasive breast cancer received during Mar/2013-Feb/2020. Participants, self-identified as non-Hispanic White or Black, underwent physical and laboratory examinations and survey questions assessing socioeconomic parameters, medical history, and behavioral risks. SSS was measured with the 10-rung MacArthur scale. MetS severity was measured with a validated Z-Score. Generalized linear mixed modeling was used to analyze the associations. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation. Average age was 58 years. On average, the SSS of Black women, given equivalent level of income and education, was lower than the SSS of White women: 6.6 (6.1-7.0) vs 7.7 (7.54-7.79) among college graduates and 6.8 (6.4-7.2) vs 7.6 (7.5-7.8) among women in the high-income category (> $75,000). In multivariable analysis, after controlling for age, income, education, diet, and physical activity, increasing SSS was associated with a decrease in MetS-Z score, - 0.10 (- 0.16 to - 0.04) per every 2 rung increase in the MacArthur scale. Black women with breast cancer rank their SSS lower than White women with breast cancer do at each level of income and education.

In all, 293 patients with synchronous ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastasis across three centers were included. Of these, 85 (29.0%) received supraclavicular lymph node dissection plus RT (Surgery + RT) and 208 (71.0%) received RT alone. All patients received preoperative systemic therapy followed by mastectomy or lumpectomy and axillary dissection. Supraclavicular recurrence-free survival (SCRFS), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated by using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox models. Multiple imputation was used for missing data. The median follow-up duration of the RT and Surgery + RT groups were 53.7 and 63.5 months, respectively. For the RT and Surgery + RT groups, the 5-year SCRFS rates were 91.7% vs. 85.5% (P = 0.522), LRRFS rates were 79.1% vs. 73.1% (P = 0.412), DMFS rates were 60.4 vs. 58.8% (P = 0.708), DFS rates were 57.6% vs. 49.7% (P = 0.291), and OS rates were 71.9% vs. 62.2% (P = 0.272), respectively. There was no significant effect on any outcome when comparing Surgery + RT versus RT alone in the multivariate analysis. Based on four risk factors of DFS, patients were classified into three risk groups: the intermediate- and high-risk groups had significantly lower survival outcomes than the low-risk group. Surgery + RT did not improve outcomes of any risk group compared with RT alone.

36915158,Long-term effects of aromatase inhibitors on body mass index among postmenopausal breast cancer survivors in Africa: observational cohort study.,"this study was conducted to assess the impact of AIs on body mass index and high sensitivity as prognostic predictors to be incorporated into point of care technology (POCT) testing in postmenopausal breast cancer women after a 24 month follow up in Africa. An observational cohort study was conducted; including 126 female BC patients with stages ranging from 0-III initially subjected to AIs and subsequently followed up for 24 months. Multiple imputation model was conducted to predict missing data. Random effects model was used to monitor the changes over the time. The study revealed stronger statistically association between BMI and homocysteine (p = 0.021, 95%CI: 0.0083 to 0.1029). Weight and total body fat were strongly associated after 24 months follow up. Hs-CRP was associated with BMI (p = 0.0001), and hs-CRP was associated with other biomedical markers such as calcium (p = 0.021, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.10), phosphate (p = 0.039, 95%CI: 0.01 to 0.10), and ferritin (p = 0.002, 95%CI: 0.02 to 0.08) and calcium. The patients subjected to AIs are likely to develop cardiovascular adverse events.

36809492,"Severity and risk factors of interval breast cancer in Queensland, Australia: a population-based study.","Interval breast cancers (BC) are those diagnosed within 24 months of a negative mammogram. This study estimates the odds of being diagnosed with high-severity BC among screen-detected, interval, and other symptom-detected BC (no screening history within 2 years); and explores factors associated with being diagnosed with interval BC. Telephone interviews and self-administered questionnaires were conducted among women (n = 3,326) diagnosed with BC in 2010-2013 in Queensland. Respondents were categorised into screen-detected, interval, and other symptom-detected BCs. Data were analysed using logistic regressions with multiple imputation. Compared with screen-detected BC, interval BC had higher odds of late-stage (OR = 3.50, 2.9-4.3), high-grade (OR = 2.36, 1.9-2.9) and triple-negative cancers (OR = 2.55, 1.9-3.5). Compared with other symptom-detected BC, interval BC had lower odds of late stage (OR = 0.75, 0.6-0.9), but higher odds of triple-negative cancers (OR = 1.68, 1.2-2.3). Among women who had a negative mammogram (n = 2,145), 69.8% were diagnosed at their next mammogram, while 30.2% were diagnosed with an interval cancer. Those with an interval cancer were more likely to have healthy weight (OR = 1.37, 1.1-1.7), received hormone replacement therapy (2-10 years: OR = 1.33, 1.0-1.7; > 10 years: OR = 1.55, 1.1-2.2), conducted monthly breast self-examinations (BSE) (OR = 1.66, 1.2-2.3) and had previous mammogram in a public facility (OR = 1.52, 1.2-2.0). These results highlight the benefits of screening even among those with an interval cancer. Women-conducted BSE were more likely to have interval BC which may reflect their increased ability to notice symptoms between screening intervals.","Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan)",2023,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
36648694,Comparison between de novo and metachronous metastatic breast cancer: the presence of a primary tumour is not the only difference-a Dutch population-based study from 2008 to 2018.,"The aim of this study was to compare characteristics and survival of patients with de novo and metachronous metastatic breast cancer. Data of patients with metastatic breast cancer were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patients were categorized as having de novo metastatic breast cancer (n = 8656) if they had distant metastases at initial presentation, or metachronous metastatic disease (n = 2374) in case they developed metastases within 5 or 10 years after initial breast cancer diagnosis. Clinicopathological characteristics and treatments of these two groups were compared, after which multiple imputation was performed to account for missing data. Overall survival was compared for patients treated with systemic therapy in the metastatic setting, using Kaplan Meier curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. The hazard ratio for overall survival of de novo versus metachronous metastases was assessed accounting for time-varying effects. Compared to metachronous patients, patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer were more likely to be ≥ 70 years, to have invasive lobular carcinoma, clinical T3 or T4 tumours, loco-regional lymph node metastases, HER2 positivity, bone only disease and to have received systemic therapy in the metastatic setting. They were less likely to have triple negative tumours and liver or brain metastases. Patients with de novo metastases survived longer (median 34.7 months) than patients with metachronous metastases (median 24.3 months) and the hazard ratio (0.75) varied over time. Differences in clinicopathological characteristics and survival between de novo and metachronous metastatic breast cancer highlight that these are distinct patients groups.",Breast cancer research and treatment,2023,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
36497208,External Validation of the Individualized Prediction of Breast Cancer Survival (IPBS) Model for Estimating Survival after Surgery for Patients with Breast Cancer in Northern Thailand.,"The individualized prediction of breast cancer survival (IPBS) model was recently developed. Although the model showed acceptable performance during derivation, its external performance remained unknown. This study aimed to validate the IPBS model using the data of breast cancer patients in Northern Thailand. An external validation study was conducted based on female patients with breast cancer who underwent surgery at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital from 2005 to 2015. Data on IPBS predictors were collected. The endpoints were 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The model performance was evaluated in terms of discrimination and calibration. Missing data were handled with multiple imputation. Of all 3581 eligible patients, 1868 were included. The 5-year OS and DFS were 85.2% and 81.9%. The IPBS model showed acceptable discrimination: C-statistics 0.706 to 0.728 for OS and 0.675 to 0.689 for DFS at 5 years. However, the IPBS model minimally overestimated both OS and DFS predictions. These overestimations were corrected after model recalibration. In this external validation study, the IPBS model exhibited good discriminative ability. Although it may provide minimal overestimation, recalibrating the model to the local context is a practical solution to improve the model calibration.",Cancers,2022,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
36408954,Effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy for elderly patients with triple-negative breast cancer.,"There is little evidence determining whether elderly patients (from 70 to 90 years old) with triple-negative breast cancer could benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (AC).  This study explores the effect of AC in these population following surgery. A total of 4610 patients were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2010-2018). Multiple imputation by chained equations was performed to impute missing data. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied to reduce the selection bias. IPTW-adjusted Kaplan-Meiers survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were performed to compare breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) in the two treatment groups. The patients were classified into the chemotherapy (n=1989) and the observation (n=2621) groups. The percentage of patients receiving AC versus observation increased significantly from 2010 to 2018 (estimated annual percentage change, 1.49%; 95%CI, 0.75-2.16%, p=0.002). The 5-year IPTW-adjusted rates of BCSS and OS in AC group were better than that in observation group (BCSS: 82.32% vs. 78.42%, p=0.010; OS: 75.54% vs. 64.65%, p<0.001). The patients could benefit from AC based on the results of IPTW-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (BCSS: HR, 0.77, 95%CI, 0.62-0.94, p=0.012; OS: HR, 0.66, 95%CI, 0.57-0.78, p<0.001). AC was associated with a significant outcome benefit across the year at diagnosis, marital status, stage, lymph node, surgery, and radiation subgroups (all p<0.050). Patients with T1ab could not benefit from AC (p>0.050). In conclusion, we presented a BCSS and OS benefit from AC in elderly patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). AC remained a reasonable treatment approach in these specific patients. For the patients with T1ab, de-escalated treatment would be administrated with caution.",Biomolecules & biomedicine,2023,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
36345809,Effectiveness research in oncology with electronic health record data: A retrospective cohort study emulating the PALOMA-2 trial.,"Oncology electronic health record (EHR) databases have increased in quality and availability over the past decade, yet it remains unclear whether these clinical practice data can be used to conduct reliable comparative effectiveness studies. We sought to emulate a clinical trial with EHR data in the advanced breast cancer population and compare our results against the trial. This cohort study used EHR data from US oncology practices. All elements of the study were defined to mimic the PALOMA-2 trial as closely as possible. Patients with hormone-positive, HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer with no prior treatment for metastatic disease were included. Patients initiating palbociclib and letrozole on the same day following the earliest record of metastasis were compared to those initiating letrozole only. The primary associational measure was the conditional hazard ratio for time-to-next treatment (TTNT). TTNT is well-measured in our data source and amenable for calibration against the randomized study results of the PALOMA-2 trial. We used multiple imputation for several patient characteristics with missing values. There were 3836 study-eligible women with advanced breast cancer. The hazard ratio for TTNT in the observational study (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.56-0.68) was closely aligned with that of the randomized trial (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.52-0.78). Under our assumptions on missing data and comparability of the two study populations, results from our non-randomized study closely matched that of the randomized trial.

We identified 2869 cases. Cause-specific survival for the entire sample was 96% 1 year after diagnosis, 91% at 3 years and 87% at 5 years. Relative survival was 96.9% 1 year after diagnosis, 92.6% at 3 years and 88.5% at 5 years.

However, survival benefit is less-well established and seems mostly limited to node-positive patients. We used national cancer registry data to compare outcomes of patients treated with and without pertuzumab. We identified stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy between November 2013 until January 2016 from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. During that period pertuzumab was only available in the 37 hospitals that participated in the TRAIN-2 study. Missing grade and pCR-status were obtained from the Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA) and cause of death from Statistics Netherlands. We used multiple imputation to impute missing data, multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the association between pertuzumab and pCR (ypT0/is, ypN0) and multivariable Cox regression models for overall survival and breast cancer specific survival (BCSS). We identified 1124 patients of whom 453 received pertuzumab. Baseline characteristics were comparable, although tumor grade was missing more often in patients treated without pertuzumab (12% vs. 2%). Pertuzumab improved pCR rates (41% vs 65%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.91; 95% CI:2.20-3.94). After a median follow-up of 6.0 years, 5-year BCSS rates were 95% and 98% respectively (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.58; 95% CI:0.36-0.95). Younger patients derived more benefit from pertuzumab, but no other significant interactions were found. These results support earlier data of a small survival benefit with the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy which is most meaningful in younger patients.","Breast (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2022,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
35896851,"A prognostic survival model for women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in Queensland, Australia.","Prognostic models can help inform patients on the future course of their cancer and assist the decision making of clinicians and patients in respect to management and treatment of the cancer. In contrast to previous studies considering survival following treatment, this study aimed to develop a prognostic model to quantify breast cancer-specific survival at the time of diagnosis. A large (n = 3323), population-based prospective cohort of women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in Queensland, Australia between 2010 and 2013, and followed up to December 2018. Data were collected through a validated semi-structured telephone interview and a self-administered questionnaire, along with data linkage to the Queensland Cancer Register and additional extraction from medical records. Flexible parametric survival models, with multiple imputation to deal with missing data, were used. Key factors identified as being predictive of poorer survival included more advanced stage at diagnosis, higher tumour grade, ""triple negative"" breast cancers, and being symptom-detected rather than screen detected. The Harrell's C-statistic for the final predictive model was 0.84 (95% CI 0.82, 0.87), while the area under the ROC curve for 5-year mortality was 0.87. The final model explained about 36% of the variation in survival, with stage at diagnosis alone explaining 26% of the variation. In addition to confirming the prognostic importance of stage, grade and clinical subtype, these results highlighted the independent survival benefit of breast cancers diagnosed through screening, although lead and length time bias should be considered. Understanding what additional factors contribute to the substantial unexplained variation in survival outcomes remains an important objective.",Breast cancer research and treatment,2022,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
35818026,Is age at menopause decreasing? - The consequences of not completing the generational cohort.,"Due to contradictory results in current research, whether age at menopause is increasing or decreasing in Western countries remains an open question, yet worth studying as later ages at menopause are likely to be related to an increased risk of breast cancer. Using data from breast cancer screening programs to study the temporal trend of age at menopause is difficult since especially younger women in the same generational cohort have often not yet reached menopause. Deleting these younger women in a breast cancer risk analyses may bias the results. The aim of this study is therefore to recover missing menopause ages as a covariate by comparing methods for handling missing data. Additionally, the study makes a contribution to understanding the evolution of age at menopause for several generations born in Portugal between 1920 and 1970. Data from a breast cancer screening program in Portugal including 278,282 women aged 45-69 and collected between 1990 and 2010 are used to compare two approaches of imputing age at menopause: (i) a multiple imputation methodology based on a truncated distribution but ignoring the mechanism of missingness; (ii) a copula-based multiple imputation method that simultaneously handles the age at menopause and the missing mechanism. The linear predictors considered in both cases have a semiparametric additive structure accommodating linear and non-linear effects defined via splines or Markov random fields smoothers in the case of spatial variables. Both imputation methods unveiled an increasing trend of age at menopause when viewed as a function of the birth year for the youngest generation. This trend is hidden if we model only women with an observed age at menopause. When studying age at menopause, missing ages must be recovered with an adequate procedure for incomplete data. Imputing these missing ages avoids excluding the younger generation cohort of the screening program in breast cancer risk analyses and hence reduces the bias stemming from this exclusion. In addition, imputing the not yet observed ages of menopause for mostly younger women is also crucial when studying the time trend of age at menopause otherwise the analysis will be biased.",BMC medical research methodology,2022,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
35788969,Unified estimation for Cox regression model with nonmonotone missing at random covariates.,"This article investigates a unified estimator for Cox regression model (Cox, 1972) when covariate data are missing at random (Rubin, 1976). It extends the idea of using parametric working models (Zhao and Liu, 2021) to extract the partial information contained in the incomplete observations. The working models are flexible and convenient to deal with nonmonotone missing data patterns. It can also incorporate auxiliary variables into the analysis to reduce estimation bias and improve efficiency. The unified estimator is consistent and more efficient than the (weighted) complete case estimator. Similar to multiple imputation (MI) method (Rubin, 1987 and 1996), the proposed method is also based on standard (weighted) complete data analysis and can be easily implemented in standard software. Simulation studies comparing the unified estimator with the substantive model compatible modification of the fully conditional specification MI (SMC-FCS) estimator (Bartlett et al., 2015) in various settings indicate that the unified estimator is consistent and as efficient as SMC-FCS estimator.

35723083,Regional inequalities of tumour size at diagnosis in Germany: An ecological study in eight federal states.,"There is growing recognition of the importance of the residential environment for early detection of cancer. However, few studies have investigated area socioeconomic deprivation, social capital, and rurality in combination. Therefore, we aimed to estimate mutually adjusted associations of these characteristics with tumour size at diagnosis in Germany. We included incident cases of female breast cancer, colorectal cancer, malignant melanoma, uterine cancer, and male bladder cancer, collected by the cancer registries of eight German federal states between 2010 and 2014. Using information on T status at diagnosis, we defined an advanced tumour size for each cancer type. Sex-specific mutually adjusted associations of area socioeconomic deprivation, social capital, and rurality with an advanced tumour size and variance partition coefficients were estimated in multilevel logistic regression. Missing data of the outcome were addressed by multiple imputation. Overall, 386 223 cases were included in this analysis. High area socioeconomic deprivation was associated with an advanced tumour size at diagnosis of colorectal cancer and malignant melanoma. For malignant melanoma, low social capital was associated with an advanced tumour size among females and males, while a rural settlement structure was associated with an advanced tumour size among males only. Since meaningful general contextual effects were found for malignant melanoma, our results underscore that the residential environment is an important predictor of melanoma tumour size. Secondary prevention programmes for this cancer type should target areas with high area socioeconomic deprivation, low social capital, and a rural settlement structure in order to reach those most vulnerable.",International journal of cancer,2022,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
35715629,Obtaining long-term stage-specific relative survival estimates in the presence of incomplete historical stage information.,"Completeness of recording for cancer stage at diagnosis is often historically poor in cancer registries, making it challenging to provide long-term stage-specific survival estimates. Stage-specific survival differences are driven by differences in short-term prognosis, meaning estimated survival metrics using period analysis are unlikely to be sensitive to imputed historical stage data. We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program for lung, colon and breast cancer. To represent missing data patterns in less complete registry data, we artificially inflated the proportion of missing stage information conditional on stage at diagnosis and calendar year of diagnosis. Period analysis was applied and missing stage at diagnosis information was imputed under four different conditions to emulate extreme imputed stage distributions. We fit a flexible parametric model for each cancer stage on the excess hazard scale and the differences in stage-specific marginal relative survival were assessed. Estimates were also obtained from non-parametric approaches for validation. There was little difference between the 10-year stage-specific marginal relative survival estimates, regardless of the assumed historical stage distribution. When conducting a period analysis, multiple imputation can be used to obtain stage-specific long-term estimates of relative survival, even when the historical stage information is largely incomplete.",British journal of cancer,2022,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
35715538,Outcomes after treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy including taxanes and/or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor use: findings from a multi-institutional retrospective analysis.,"Guidelines support comparable treatment for women diagnosed with breast cancer during pregnancy (PrBC) and nonpregnant women with limited case-specific modifications to ensure maternal-fetal safety. Experience during pregnancy with modern agents, such as taxanes or granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (GCSF), is limited. We retrospectively identified a multi-institutional cohort of PrBC between 1996 and 2020. Propensity score analyses with multiple imputation for missing variables were applied to determine the associations between chemotherapy exposures during pregnancy, with or without taxanes or GCSF, and a compound maternal-fetal outcome including spontaneous preterm birth, preterm premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, small for gestational age newborns, congenital malformation, or 5-min Apgar score < 7. Among 139 PrBC pregnancies, 82 (59.0%) were exposed to chemotherapy, including 26 (31.7%) to taxane and 18 (22.0%) to GCSF. Chemotherapy use, in general, and inclusion of taxane and/or GCSF, specifically, increased over time. Pregnancies resulting in live singleton births (n = 123) and exposed to chemotherapy were as likely to reach term as those that were not (59.5% vs. 63.6%, respectively, p<sub>unadjusted</sub> = 0.85). Among women treated with chemotherapy, propensity score-matched odds ratios (OR) for the composite maternal-fetal outcome were not significantly increased with taxane (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.27-5.72) or GCSF (OR 2.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-9.22) with similar effects in multiple imputation and sensitivity models. The judicious increased use of taxane chemotherapy and/or growth factor support during pregnancy was not associated with unfavorable short-term maternal-fetal outcomes. While these findings are reassuring, case numbers remain limited and continued surveillance of these patients and progeny is warranted.",Breast cancer research and treatment,2022,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
35708191,Weighted log-rank test to compare two survival functions in the presence of dependent censoring.,"Comparing survival functions with the log-rank test in the presence of dependent censoring can produce an invalid test result. We extend our previous work on the estimation of the survival function using prognostic variables to adjust for dependent censoring to the comparison of two survival distributions. In these estimators, the weights of a censored individual is redistributed among either a subset of patients in the risk set or all patients in the risk set but giving more weight to patients having smallest distances from the censored subject. The distance is based on two risk scores obtained from two working models, one for the failure time and one for the censoring time. Based on the estimators, we suggest a weighted log-rank test to compare two survival distributions. A simulation study compared performance of our method with the analysis of the observed data without using auxiliary variables and with a recent method based on multiple imputation (KMIB method). With appropriate parameters, the weighted log-rank approach provides sizes of the test comparable to the nominal value but higher powers than the two other methods. The method is illustrated with data from a breast cancer study.",Pharmaceutical statistics,2022,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
35580243,Latent Class Models of Early-life Trauma and Incident Breast Cancer.,"Psychosocial trauma has been hypothesized to influence breast cancer risk, but little is known about how co-occurring traumas-particularly during early life-may impact incidence. We examine the relationship between multiple measures of early-life trauma and incident breast cancer. The Sister Study is a prospective cohort study of US women (n = 50,884; enrollment 2003-2009; ages 35-74). Of 45,961 eligible participants, 3,070 developed invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ through 2017. We assessed trauma before age 18 using previously studied measures (cumulative score, individual trauma type, and substantive domain) and a six-class latent variable to evaluate co-occurring traumas. We accounted for missing data using multiple imputation and estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox proportional-hazards models. Approximately 49% of participants reported early-life trauma. Using the latent class variable approach, breast cancer hazard was higher among participants who had sexual trauma or household dysfunction (HR = 1.1; CI = 0.93, 1.3) or moderate (HR = 1.2; CI = 0.99, 1.4) but not high trauma (HR = 0.66; CI = 0.44, 0.99) compared to low trauma. Breast cancer HRs associated with sexual early-life trauma or household dysfunction were elevated for pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer and by estrogen receptor status. We found no effect modification by race-ethnicity. Estimated effects were attenuated with report of constant childhood social support. Breast cancer incidence varied by latent patterns of co-occurring early-life trauma. Models capturing childhood social support and trauma patterning, rather than cumulative or discrete indicators, may be more meaningful in breast cancer risk assessment.","Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",2022,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
35137329,CD68 and CD83 immune populations in non-metastatic axillary lymph nodes are of prognostic value for the survival and relapse of breast cancer patients.,"The foremost cause of death of breast cancer (BC) patients is metastasis, and the first site to which BC predominantly metastasizes is the axillary lymph node (ALN). Thus, ALN status is a key prognostic indicator at diagnosis. The immune system has an essential role in cancer progression and dissemination, so its evaluation in ALNs could have significant applications. In the present study we aimed to investigate the association of clinical-pathological and immune variables in the primary tumour and non-metastatic ALNs (ALNs<sup>-</sup>) of a cohort of luminal A and triple-negative BC (TNBC) patients with cancer-specific survival (CSS) and time to progression (TTP). We analysed the differences in the variables between patients with different outcomes, created univariate and multivariate Cox regression models, validated them by bootstrapping and multiple imputation of missing data techniques, and used Kaplan-Meier survival curves for a 10-years follow-up. We found some clinical-pathological variables at diagnosis (tumour diameter, TNBC molecular profile and presence of ALN metastasis), and the levels of several immune markers in the two studied sites, to be associated with worse CSS and TTP. Nevertheless, only CD68 and CD83 in ALNs<sup>-</sup> were confirmed as independent prognostic factors for TTP. The study identified the importance of macrophage and dendritic cell markers as prognostic factors of relapse for BC. We highlight the importance of studying the immune response in ALNs<sup>-</sup>, which could be relevant to the prediction of BC patients' outcome.","Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan)",2022,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"

We followed patients diagnosed in 2007-2012 through data linkage with different databases, including the national causes of death registry and vital statistics office. We also followed the remaining patients through active contact. We used relative survival (RS) analysis to estimate 5-year age-standardized net survival for each cancer site. Multiple Imputation (MI) method was performed to obtain vital status for loss to follow-up (LTFU) cases. We followed 6910 cancer patients from Golestan PBCR. However, 2162 patients were loss to follow-up. We found a higher RS in women (29.5%, 95% CI, 27.5, 31.7) than men (21.0%, 95% CI, 19.5, 22.5). The highest RS was observed for breast cancer in women (RS=49.8%, 95% CI, 42.2, 56.9) and colon cancer in men (RS=37.9%, 95% CI, 31.2, 44.6). Pancreatic cancer had the lowest RS both in men (RS= 8.7%, 95% CI, 4.1, 13.5) and women (RS= 7.9%, 95% CI, 5.0, 10.8) CONCLUSION: Although the 5-year cancer survival rates were relatively low in the Golestan province, there were distinct variations by cancer site.

34643465,Multiple imputation with missing data indicators.,"Multiple imputation is a well-established general technique for analyzing data with missing values. A convenient way to implement multiple imputation is sequential regression multiple imputation, also called chained equations multiple imputation. In this approach, we impute missing values using regression models for each variable, conditional on the other variables in the data. This approach, however, assumes that the missingness mechanism is missing at random, and it is not well-justified under not-at-random missingness without additional modification. In this paper, we describe how we can generalize the sequential regression multiple imputation imputation procedure to handle missingness not at random in the setting where missingness may depend on other variables that are also missing but not on the missing variable itself, conditioning on fully observed variables. We provide algebraic justification for several generalizations of standard sequential regression multiple imputation using Taylor series and other approximations of the target imputation distribution under missingness not at random. Resulting regression model approximations include indicators for missingness, interactions, or other functions of the missingness not at random missingness model and observed data. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that the proposed sequential regression multiple imputation modifications result in reduced bias in the final analysis compared to standard sequential regression multiple imputation, with an approximation strategy involving inclusion of an offset in the imputation model performing the best overall. The method is illustrated in a breast cancer study, where the goal is to estimate the prevalence of a specific genetic pathogenic variant.",Statistical methods in medical research,2021,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
34429658,Combined Lifestyle Behaviors and the Incidence of Common Cancer Types in the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study (NOWAC).,"Only a small number of studies have examined the impact of combined lifestyle behaviors on cancer incidence, and never in a Norwegian population. To examine linear and nonlinear associations of combined lifestyle factors, assessed through a healthy lifestyle index (HLI), with the incidence of postmenopausal breast, colorectal, lung, postmenopausal endometrial, postmenopausal ovarian, pancreatic, and kidney cancer among women in Norway. This prospective study included 96,869 women enrolled in the Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) cohort. Baseline information on lifestyle factors was collected between 1996 and 2004. The HLI was constructed from five lifestyle factors: physical activity level, body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, and diet. Each factor contributed 0 to 4 points to the HLI score, which ranged from 0 to 20, with higher scores representing a healthier lifestyle. Multiple imputation was used to handle missing data. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Restricted cubic splines were used to examine nonlinearity in the associations. The HRs for a one-point increment on the HLI score were 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.98) for postmenopausal breast cancer, 0.98 (0.96-1.00) for colorectal cancer, 0.86 (0.84-0.87) for lung cancer, 0.93 (0.91-0.95) for postmenopausal endometrial cancer, 0.99 (0.96-1.02) for postmenopausal ovarian cancer, 0.92 (0.89-0.95) for pancreatic cancer, and 0.94 (0.91-0.97) for kidney cancer. Nonlinearity was observed for the inverse associations between HLI score and the incidence of lung cancer and postmenopausal breast cancer. Based on our results, healthier lifestyle, as assessed by the HLI score, was associated with lower incidence of postmenopausal breast, colorectal, lung, postmenopausal endometrial, pancreatic, and kidney cancer among women, although the magnitude and linearity varied. Adoption of healthier lifestyle behaviors should be a public health priority to reduce the cancer burden among Norwegian women.",Clinical epidemiology,2021,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
34342765,Risk factors for breast cancer subtypes among Black women undergoing screening mammography.,"Black women are more likely than non-Hispanic White women to be diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype with limited treatment options. The study objective was to evaluate the associations of known breast cancer risk factors, including breast density, with TNBC among Black women. This study included Black women who underwent screening mammography between the ages of 40-84 years at a University of Pennsylvania Health System between 2010 and 2015. Cox proportional hazard models using multiple imputation with chained equations were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for risk factors for ER/PR+/HER2- and TNBC. Among 25,013 Black women, there were 330 incident breast cancers (1.3%) during a mean follow-up of 5.8 years; 218 (66.1%) ER/PR+ HER- and 61 (18.1%) TNBC. Having dense breasts (heterogeneously dense or extremely dense) vs. non-dense breasts (almost entirely fatty or scattered areas of fibroglandular density) increased risk of ER/PR+/HER2- breast cancer almost 80% (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.32-2.43) and TNBC more than twofold (HR 2.53, 1.45-4.44). Older age was associated with an increased risk for ER/PR+/HER2- (HR 1.04, 1.03-1.06) and TNBC (HR 1.03, 1.00-1.05). Having a BMI of > 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> was associated with an increased risk (HR 2.77, 1.05-7.30) for TNBC and an increased risk of ERPR+/HER2- breast cancer in postmenopausal but not pre-menopausal women (p-interaction = 0.016). Our results suggest that breast density and obesity are strong risk factors for TNBC among Black women. Understanding breast cancer subtype specific risk factors among Black women can help improve risk assessment.",Breast cancer research and treatment,2021,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
34287838,Delays in breast cancer care by race and sexual orientation: Results from a national survey with diverse women in the United States.,"Despite known differences in breast cancer by both race and sexual orientation, data on the intersectional experiences of Black sexual minority women (BSMW) along the care continuum are scant. This study sought to understand delays in breast cancer care by examining the intersection of race and sexual orientation. This online, cross-sectional survey enrolled racially and sexually diverse women aged ≥ 35 years who had been diagnosed with breast cancer within the prior 10 years or had an abnormal screening in the prior 24 months. The authors calculated summary statistics by race/sexual orientation categories, and they conducted univariate and multivariable modeling by using multiple imputation for missing data. BSMW (n = 101) had the highest prevalence of care delays with 5.17-fold increased odds of a care delay in comparison with White heterosexual women (n = 298) in multivariable models. BSMW reported higher intersectional stigma and lower social support than all other groups. In models adjusted for race, sexual orientation, and income, intersectional stigma was associated with a 2.43-fold increase in care delays, and social support was associated with a 32% decrease in the odds of a care delay. Intersectional stigma may be an important driver of breast cancer inequities for BSMW. Reducing stigma and ensuring access to appropriate social support that addresses known barriers can be an important approach to reducing inequities in the breast cancer care continuum.",Cancer,2021,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
34213659,Psychological consequences of MRI-based screening among women with strong family histories of breast cancer.,"MRI-based screening in women with a ≥ 25% lifetime risk of breast cancer , but no identifiable genetic mutations may be associated with false positives. This study examined the psychological impact of abnormal screens and biopsies in non-mutation carriers participating in high-risk screening with no personal history of breast cancer. Non-mutation carriers participating in the High-Risk Ontario Breast Screening Program at two sites were mailed demographic surveys, psychological scales, and chart review consent. Scales included the Consequences of Screening in Breast Cancer questionnaire, Lerman Breast Cancer Worry Scale, and Worry Interference Scale. Missing data were managed with multiple imputation. Multivariable regression was used to assess whether abnormal screens or biopsies were associated with adverse psychological effects. After contacting 465 participants, 169 non-mutation carriers were included. Median age was 46 years (range 30-65). Over a median 3 years of screening, 63.9% of women experienced at least one abnormal screen, and 24.9% underwent biopsies. Statements relating to cancer worry/anxiety scored highest, with 19.5% indicating they worried ""a lot"". Higher scores among anxiety-related statements were strongly associated with higher dejection scores. Overall, coping and daily functioning were preserved. Women indicated some positive reactions to screening, including improved existential values and reassurance they do not have breast cancer. Abnormal screens and biopsies were not significantly associated with any psychological scale, even after adjustment for patient characteristics. Non-mutation carriers undergoing MRI-based screening had considerable baseline anxiety and cancer worry, although daily functioning was not impaired. Abnormal screens and biopsies did not appear to have adverse psychological effects.",Breast cancer research and treatment,2021,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
34180091,Multiobjective semisupervised learning with a right-censored endpoint adapted to the multiple imputation framework.,"Semisupervised learning aims to use additional knowledge in the search for data structure. In clinical applications, including predictive information in the construction of a data-driven classification is of major importance. This work was motivated by a study that aimed to identify different patterns of immune parameters that would be associated with relapse-free survival in a cohort of breast cancer patients. Supervised and unsupervised objectives can be concomitantly optimized using multiobjective optimization. We propose such a procedure that addresses two challenges in the semisupervised approach, that is, missing data and additional knowledge based on survival time. The former was handled by using multiple imputation and consensus clustering. Survival information was incorporated in the supervised objective through the estimation of a cross-validation error of a Cox regression. A simulation study was performed to assess the performance of the proposed procedure. On complete datasets, the performances were compared to those of an existing modified multiobjective semisupervised learning method. The added value of including the survival data in the learning process was assessed by comparing the procedure to unsupervised learning. The proposed procedure showed better performance than the existing method, notably in the selection of the number of clusters. On incomplete datasets, the procedure showed little sensitivity to most of its parameters, even though a high number of imputations and partition initialization seeds improved the performance. The performance was degraded with a high proportion of missing data (40%) and with more ambiguous data structures. Simulation results and application on real data support the conclusion that our procedure enables the construction of a classification associated with a right-censored endpoint on a possibly incomplete dataset.",Biometrical journal.

34178808,Prediction of Breast Cancer Survival by Machine Learning Methods: An Application of Multiple Imputation.,"The low breast cancer survival rates in less developed countries are critical. The machine learning techniques predict cancers survival with high accuracy. Missing data are the most important limitation for using the highest potential of these techniques to predict cancers survival. Multiple imputation (MI) was implemented and analyzed in detail to impute the missing data of a breast cancer dataset. The dataset was from The Omid Treatment and Research Center Urmia, Iran between Jan 2006 and Dec 2012 and had information from 856 women. The algorithms such as C5 and repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction were applied on the imputed versions of the original dataset and the non-imputed dataset to predict and extract clinical rules, respectively. The findings showed the performance of C5 in all the evaluation criteria including accuracy (84.42%), sensitivity (92.21%), specificity (64%), Kappa statistic (59.06%), and the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (0.84), was improved after imputation. The dataset of the present study met the requirements for using the multiple imputation method. The extracted rules after the application of MI were more comprehensive and contained knowledge that is more clinical. However, the clinical value of the extracted rules after filling in the missing data did not noticeably increase.",Iranian journal of public health,2021,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
34157725,Validation of the Skåne University Hospital nomogram for the preoperative prediction of a disease-free axilla in patients with breast cancer.,"Axillary staging via sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is performed for clinically node-negative (N0) breast cancer patients. The Skåne University Hospital (SUS) nomogram was developed to assess the possibility of omitting SLNB for patients with a low risk of nodal metastasis. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.74. The aim was to validate the SUS nomogram using only routinely collected data from the Swedish National Quality Registry for Breast Cancer at two breast cancer centres during different time periods. This retrospective study included patients with primary breast cancer who were treated at centres in Lund and Malmö during 2008-2013. Clinicopathological predictors in the SUS nomogram were age, mode of detection, tumour size, multifocality, lymphovascular invasion and surrogate molecular subtype. Multiple imputation was used for missing data. Validation performance was assessed using AUC and calibration. The study included 2939 patients (1318 patients treated in Lund and 1621 treated in Malmö). Node-positive disease was detected in 1008 patients. The overall validation AUC was 0.74 (Lund cohort AUC: 0.75, Malmö cohort AUC: 0.73), and the calibration was satisfactory. Accepting a false-negative rate of 5 per cent for predicting N0, a possible SLNB reduction rate of 15 per cent was obtained in the overall cohort. The SUS nomogram provided acceptable power for predicting a disease-free axilla in the validation cohort. This tool may assist surgeons in identifying and counselling patients with a low risk of nodal metastasis on the omission of SLNB staging.",BJS open,2021,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
33938501,Major Depression and Survival in People With Cancer.,"The question of whether depression is associated with worse survival in people with cancer remains unanswered because of methodological criticism of the published research on the topic. We aimed to study the association in a large methodologically robust study. We analyzed data on 20,582 patients with breast, colorectal, gynecological, lung, and prostate cancers who had attended cancer outpatient clinics in Scotland, United Kingdom. Patients had completed two-stage screening for major depression as part of their cancer care. These data on depression status were linked to demographic, cancer, and subsequent mortality data from national databases. We estimated the association of major depression with survival for each cancer using Cox regression. We adjusted for potential confounders and interactions between potentially time-varying confounders and the interval between cancer diagnosis and depression screening, and used multiple imputation for missing depression and confounder data. We pooled the cancer-specific results using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Major depression was associated with worse survival for all cancers, with similar adjusted hazard ratios (HRs): breast cancer (HR = 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-1.75), colorectal cancer (HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.11-1.94), gynecological cancer (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.08-1.71), lung cancer (HR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.24-1.56), and prostate cancer (HR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.08-2.85). The pooled HR was 1.41 (95% CI = 1.29-1.54, p < .001, I2 = 0%). These findings were not materially different when we only considered the deaths (90%) that were attributed to cancer. Major depression is associated with worse survival in patients with common cancers. The mechanisms of this association and the clinical implications require further study.",Psychosomatic medicine,2021,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
33933034,Are socio-economic inequalities in breast cancer survival explained by peri-diagnostic factors?,"Patients living in more deprived localities have lower cancer survival in England, but the role of individual health status at diagnosis and the utilisation of primary health care in explaining these differentials has not been widely considered. We set out to evaluate whether pre-existing individual health status at diagnosis and primary care consultation history (peri-diagnostic factors) could explain socio-economic differentials in survival amongst women diagnosed with breast cancer. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women aged 15-99 years diagnosed in England using linked routine data. Ecologically-derived measures of income deprivation were combined with individually-linked data from the English National Cancer Registry, Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) databases. Smoking status, alcohol consumption, BMI, comorbidity, and consultation histories were derived for all patients. Time to breast surgery was derived for women diagnosed after 2005. We estimated net survival and modelled the excess hazard ratio of breast cancer death using flexible parametric models. We accounted for missing data using multiple imputation. Net survival was lower amongst more deprived women, with a single unit increase in deprivation quintile inferring a 4.4% (95% CI 1.4-8.8) increase in excess mortality. Peri-diagnostic co-variables varied by deprivation but did not explain the differentials in multivariable analyses. These data show that socio-economic inequalities in survival cannot be explained by consultation history or by pre-existing individual health status, as measured in primary care. Differentials in the effectiveness of treatment, beyond those measuring the inclusion of breast surgery and the timing of surgery, should be considered as part of the wider effort to reduce inequalities in premature mortality.",BMC cancer,2021,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
33884937,Using multiple imputation to classify potential outcomes subgroups.,"With medical tests becoming increasingly available, concerns about over-testing, over-treatment and health care cost dramatically increase. Hence, it is important to understand the influence of testing on treatment selection in general practice. Most statistical methods focus on average effects of testing on treatment decisions. However, this may be ill-advised, particularly for patient subgroups that tend not to benefit from such tests. Furthermore, missing data are common, representing large and often unaddressed threats to the validity of most statistical methods. Finally, it is often desirable to conduct analyses that can be interpreted causally. Using the Rubin Causal Model framework, we propose to classify patients into four potential outcomes subgroups, defined by whether or not a patient's treatment selection is changed by the test result and by the direction of how the test result changes treatment selection. This subgroup classification naturally captures the differential influence of medical testing on treatment selections for different patients, which can suggest targets to improve the utilization of medical tests. We can then examine patient characteristics associated with patient potential outcomes subgroup memberships. We used multiple imputation methods to simultaneously impute the missing potential outcomes as well as regular missing values. This approach can also provide estimates of many traditional causal quantities of interest. We find that explicitly incorporating causal inference assumptions into the multiple imputation process can improve the precision for some causal estimates of interest. We also find that bias can occur when the potential outcomes conditional independence assumption is violated; sensitivity analyses are proposed to assess the impact of this violation. We applied the proposed methods to examine the influence of 21-gene assay, the most commonly used genomic test in the United States, on chemotherapy selection among breast cancer patients.",Statistical methods in medical research,2021,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
33794301,Clinical Predictors for Analgesic Response to Radiotherapy in Patients with Painful Bone Metastases.,"Radiotherapy (RT) reduces pain in about 60% of patients with painful bone metastases, leaving many patients without clinical benefit. This study assesses predictors for RT effectiveness in patients with painful bone metastases. We included adult patients receiving RT for painful bone metastases in a multicenter, multinational longitudinal observational study. Pain response within 8 weeks was defined as ≥2-point decrease on a 0-10 pain score scale, without increase in analgesics; or a decrease in analgesics of ≥25% without increase in pain score. Potential predictors were related to patient demographics, RT administration, pain characteristics, tumor characteristics, depression and inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP]). Multivariate logistic regression analysis with multiple imputation of missing data were applied to identify predictors of RT response. Of 513 eligible patients, 460 patients (90 %) were included in the regression model. 224 patients (44%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 39%-48%) responded to RT. Better Karnofsky performance status (Odds ratio (OR) 1.39, CI 1.15-1.68), breast cancer (OR 2.54, CI 1.12-5.73), prostate cancer (OR 2.83, CI 1.27-6.33) and soft tissue expansion (OR 2.00, CI 1.23-3.25) predicted RT response. Corticosteroids were a negative predictor (OR 0.57, CI 0.37-0.88). Single and multiple fraction RT had similar response. The discriminative ability of the model was moderate; C-statistic 0.69. This study supports previous findings that better performance status and type of cancer diagnosis predicts analgesic RT response, and new data showing that soft tissue expansion predicts RT response and that corticosteroids is a negative predictor for RT response in patients with painful bone metastases.",Journal of pain and symptom management,2021,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
33388324,Burden of disease from second-hand tobacco smoke exposure at home among adults from European Union countries in 2017: an analysis using a review of recent meta-analyses.,"Smoke-free legislation reduced second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure in public places, and indirectly promoted private smoke-free settings. Nevertheless, a large proportion of adults is still exposed to SHS at home. The aim of this paper is to quantify the burden of disease due to home SHS exposure among adults in the 28-European Union (EU) countries for year 2017. The burdens by gender from lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), breast cancer, ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, asthma, and diabetes were estimated in an original research analysis using the comparative risk assessment method. Relative risks of death/diseases by gender for adults exposed to SHS at home compared to not exposed ones were estimated updating existing meta-analyses. Prevalence of home SHS exposure by gender was estimated using a multiple imputation procedure based on Eurobarometer surveys. Data on mortality and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries and Risk Factors Study. In 2017, 526,000 DALYs (0.36% of total DALYs) and 24,000 deaths (0.46% of total deaths) were attributable to home SHS exposure in the 28-EU countries, mainly from COPD and IHD. South-Eastern EU countries showed the highest burden, with proportion of DALYs/deaths attributable to SHS exposure on total higher than 0.50%/0.70%, whereas northern EU-countries showed the lowest burden, with proportions of DALYs/deaths lower than 0.25%/0.34%. The burden from SHS exposure is still significant in EU countries. More could be done to raise awareness of the health risks associated with SHS exposure at home.",Preventive medicine,2021,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
33275165,Development and internal validation of a predictive risk model for anxiety after completion of treatment for early stage breast cancer.,"To develop a predictive risk model (PRM) for patient-reported anxiety after treatment completion for early stage breast cancer suitable for use in practice and underpinned by advances in data science and risk prediction. Secondary analysis of a prospective survey of > 800 women at the end of treatment and again 6 months later using patient reported outcome (PRO) the hospital anxiety and depression scale-anxiety (HADS-A) and > 20 candidate predictors. Multiple imputation using chained equations (for missing data) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were used to select predictors. Final multivariable linear model performance was assessed (R<sup>2</sup>) and bootstrapped for internal validation. Five predictors of anxiety selected by LASSO were HADS-A (Beta 0.73; 95% CI 0.681, 0.785); HAD-depression (Beta 0.095; 95% CI 0.020, 0.182) and having caring responsibilities (Beta 0.488; 95% CI 0.084, 0.866) increased risk, whereas being older (Beta - 0.010; 95% CI -0.028, 0.004) and owning a home (Beta 0.432; 95% CI -0.954, 0.078) reduced the risk. The final model explained 60% of variance and bias was low (- 0.006 to 0.002). Different modelling approaches are needed to predict rather than explain patient reported outcomes. We developed a parsimonious and pragmatic PRM. External validation is required prior to translation to digital tool and evaluation of clinical implementation.

32930928,The effect of breast MRI on disease-free and overall survival in breast cancer patients: a retrospective population-based study.,"To evaluate the effect of breast MRI on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with invasive breast cancer in the Netherlands. We selected all women from the Netherlands Cancer Registry diagnosed with invasive breast cancer (a) between 2011 and 2013 for the OS-cohort and (b) in the first quarter of 2012 for the DFS-cohort. The study population was subdivided into an MRI and non-MRI group. In addition, subgroups were created according to breast cancer subtype: invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) versus invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). OS and DFS were compared between the MRI and non-MRI group using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). To account for missing data, multiple imputation was performed. Of the 31,756 patients included in the OS-cohort (70% non-MRI and 30% MRI), 27,752 (87%) were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma NST and 4004 (13%) with ILC. Of the 2464 patients included in the DFS-cohort (72% non-MRI and 28% MRI), 2161 (88%) were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma NST and 303 (12%) with ILC. The distribution of breast MRI use was significantly lower over different age categories, from 49.0% aged < 50 to 16.5% aged > 70. Multivariable Cox regression showed that breast MRI was not significantly associated with OS overall (HR 0.91, 95%-CI 0.74-1.11, p = 0.35), nor in the different histological subtypes. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that breast MRI was also not significantly associated with DFS (HR 1.16, 95%-CI 0.81-1.67), nor in the different histological subtypes. Use of breast MRI was not significantly associated with an improved OS or DFS in patients treated with primary surgery.",Breast cancer research and treatment,2020,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
32876910,Risk factors for inflammatory and non-inflammatory breast cancer in North Africa.,"Studies of the etiology of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), a rare but aggressive breast cancer, have been hampered by limited risk factor information. We extend previous studies by evaluating a broader range of risk factors. Between 2009 and 2015, we conducted a case-control study of IBC at six centers in Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco; enrolled were 267 IBC cases and for comparison 274 non-IBC cases and 275 controls, both matched on age and geographic area to the IBC cases. We administered questionnaires and collected anthropometric measurements for all study subjects. We used multiple imputation methods to account for missing values and calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using polytomous logistic regression comparing each of the two case groups to the controls, with statistical tests for the difference between the coefficients for the two case groups. After multivariable adjustment, a livebirth within the previous 2 years (OR 4.6; 95% CI 1.8 to 11.7) and diabetes (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 3.0) were associated with increased risk of IBC, but not non-IBC (OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.3 to 2.5 and OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.5 to 1.6 for livebirth and diabetes, respectively). A family history of breast cancer, inflammatory-like breast problems, breast trauma, and low socioeconomic status were associated with increased risk of both tumor types. We identified novel risk factors for IBC and non-IBC, some of which preferentially increased risk of IBC compared to non-IBC. Upon confirmation, these findings could help illuminate the etiology and aid in prevention of this aggressive cancer.",Breast cancer research and treatment,2020,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
32627864,Clustering with missing and left-censored data: A simulation study comparing multiple-imputation-based procedures.,"Cluster analysis, commonly used to explore large biomedical datasets, can be challenging, notably due to missing data or left-censored data induced by the sensitivity limits of the biochemical measurement method. Usually, complete-case analysis, simple imputation, or stochastic simple imputation are applied before clustering. More recently, consensus methods following multiple imputation have been proposed. However, they ignore left-censoring and do not allow the number of clusters to vary across the partitions of each imputed dataset. Here, we developed a consensus-based clustering algorithm in which left-censored data are taken into account using a modified multiple imputation method and the number of clusters is estimated for each imputed dataset. A simulation study was conducted to assess the performance in terms of the number of clusters, the percentage of unclassified observations, and the adjusted Rand index. The simulation results showed that the investigated method works well compared to several alternative approaches. A real-world application in breast cancer patients showed that the proposed method may reveal novel clusters of patients.",Biometrical journal.

In this single-center observational study, we enrolled postmenopausal women with primary hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who were receiving adjuvant AI treatment. We assessed patient bone health [bone mineral density (BMD) and biomarkers of bone turnover] as main outcomes. PA was assessed using Baecke physical activity questionnaires (BPAQ) and an accelerometer. Multiple regression analysis was performed after adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking history and duration of AI treatment. For missing data, multiple imputation analysis was adapted. The mean age of the 53 enrolled patients was 67.4 ± 8.4 years. The mean duration of AI administration was 25.7 ± 18.9 months. The most frequently administered AI was anastrozole (73.6%). Although not related to BMD, PA was related to bone turnover. Serum collagen type I amino-terminal propeptide, a bone formation marker, was associated with only light PA (t =  - 2.55, p = 0.015), while tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b, a bone absorption marker, was associated with work index in the BPAQ subscale and light PA (t =  - 2.28, p = 0.028, t =  - 2.26, p = 0.031, respectively). The results for all patients were similar to those observed in the multiple imputation analysis. PA was significantly associated with bone turnover among cancer patients receiving AI treatment.

32181892,"Nativity, ethnic enclave residence, and breast cancer survival among Latinas: Variations between California and Texas.","Among Latinas with breast cancer, residence in an ethnic enclave may be associated with survival. However, findings from prior studies are inconsistent. The authors conducted parallel analyses of California and Texas cancer registry data for adult (aged ≥18 years) Latinas who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from 1996 to 2005, with follow-up through 2014. Existing indices applied to tract-level 2000 US Census data were used to measure Latinx enclaves and neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were fit for all-cause and breast cancer-specific survival adjusted for year of diagnosis, patient age, nativity (with multiple imputation), tumor stage, histology, grade, size, and clustering by census tract. Among 38,858 Latinas, the majority (61.3% in California and 70.5% in Texas) lived in enclaves. In fully adjusted models for both states, foreign-born women were found to be more likely to die of breast cancer and all causes when compared with US-born women. Living in enclaves and in neighborhoods with higher SES were found to be independently associated with improved survival from both causes. When combined into a 4-level variable, those in low nSES nonenclaves had worse survival for both causes compared with those living in low nSES enclaves and, in the all-cause but not breast cancer-specific models, those in high nSES neighborhoods, regardless of enclave status, had improved survival from all causes. Applying the same methods across 2 states eliminated previously published inconsistent associations between enclave residence and breast cancer survival. Future studies should identify specific protective effects of enclave residence to inform interventions.",Cancer,2020,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
32147404,A N0 Predicting Model for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Omission in Early Breast Cancer Upstaged From Ductal Carcinoma in Situ.,"A prediction model with high sensitivity for the detection of negative axillary involvement can reduce additional axillary surgery in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) upstaged to invasive cancer while saving patients with pure DCIS from unnecessary axillary surgeries. Using a nationwide database, we developed and validated a scoring system for guidance in selective sentinel lymph node biopsy omission. A total of 41,895 patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer from the Korean Breast Cancer Registry were included. The study cohort was randomly divided for the development and validation of the prediction model. Missing data were filled in using multiple imputation. Factors that were significantly associated with axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis in > 50% of datasets were included in the final prediction model. The frequency of ALN metastasis in the total cohort was 24.5%. After multivariable logistic regression analysis, variables that were associated with ALN metastasis were palpability, multifocality, location, size, histologic type, grade, lymphovascular invasion, hormone receptor expression, and Ki-67 level. A scoring system was developed using these factors. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the scoring system was 0.750 in both training and validating sets. The cutoff value for performing sentinel lymph node biopsy was determined as a score of 4 to obtain prediction sensitivity higher than 95%. A scoring system to predict the probability of ALN metastasis was developed and validated. The application of this system in the clinic may reduce unnecessary axillary surgeries in patients with DCIS and minimize additional axillary surgery for upstaged patients with invasive cancer.",Clinical breast cancer,2020,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
32049320,A cautionary tale on using imputation methods for inference in matched-pairs design.,"Imputation procedures in biomedical fields have turned into statistical practice, since further analyses can be conducted ignoring the former presence of missing values. In particular, non-parametric imputation schemes like the random forest have shown favorable imputation performance compared to the more traditionally used MICE procedure. However, their effect on valid statistical inference has not been analyzed so far. This article closes this gap by investigating their validity for inferring mean differences in incompletely observed pairs while opposing them to a recent approach that only works with the given observations at hand. Our findings indicate that machine-learning schemes for (multiply) imputing missing values may inflate type I error or result in comparably low power in small-to-moderate matched pairs, even after modifying the test statistics using Rubin's multiple imputation rule. In addition to an extensive simulation study, an illustrative data example from a breast cancer gene study has been considered.

31796030,Use of skincare products and risk of cancer of the breast and endometrium: a prospective cohort study.,"Concerns have been raised that extensive use of personal care products that contain endocrine disrupting compounds increase the risk of hormone sensitive cancers. To assess the effect of skincare product use on the risk of pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) breast cancer and cancer of the endometrium. We used data from 106,978 participants in the population-based Norwegian Women and Cancer cohort. Participants were categorized into non-, light, moderate, frequent and heavy users of skincare products based on self-reported use of hand and facial cream and body lotion. Cancer incidence information from the Cancer Registry of Norway was linked to individual data through the unique identity number of Norwegian citizens. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to assess the effect of skincare product use on the risk of cancer of the breast and endometrium. We used multiple imputation by chained equations to evaluate the effect of missing data on observed associations. We found no associations between use of skincare products and incidence of premenopausal breast cancer (frequent/heavy versus non-/light use: hazard ratio [HR] =1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92-1.32), postmenopausal breast cancer (heavy versus light use: HR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.65-1.18, frequent versus light use: HR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.88, 1.07) or endometrial cancer (frequent/heavy versus non-/light use: HR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.79-1.20). Use of skincare products did not increase the risk of ER+ or ER- breast cancer and there was no difference in effect across ER status (0.58 ≤ p<sub>heterogeneity</sub> ≤ 0.99). The magnitude and direction of the effect estimates based on complete case analyses and multiple imputation were similar. Heavy use of skincare products, i.e. creaming the body up to two times per day during mid-life, did not increase the risk of cancer of the breast or endometrium.",Environmental health : a global access science source,2019,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
31412822,A prospective investigation of oral contraceptive use and breast cancer mortality: findings from the Swedish women's lifestyle and health cohort.,"The association between oral contraceptive (OC) use and long-term mortality remains uncertain and previous studies have reported conflicting findings. We aim to assess the long-term impact of OC use on all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. Out of 49,259 participants, we analysed data on 2120 (4.3%) women diagnosed with first primary breast cancer between 1993 and 2012, in the Swedish Women's Lifestyle and Health Study. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to graph the hazard of mortality in association with oral contraceptives use, stage of disease and hormone receptors status at diagnosis. Cox proportional hazard model were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) between OC use and all-cause mortality. The same association was studied for breast cancer-specific mortality by modelling the log cumulative mortality risk, adjusting for clinical stage at diagnosis, hormone receptor status, body mass index and smoking. Among 2120 women with breast cancer, 1268 (84%) reported ever use of OC and 254 died within 10 years of diagnosis. The risk of death for OC ever-users relative to never-users was: HR = 1.13 (95% CI: 0.66-1.94) for all-cause mortality and HR = 1.29 (95% CI: 0.53-3.18) for breast cancer-specific mortality. A high percentage of women (42.9%) were diagnosed at early stage disease (stage I). Among women with primary breast cancer, OC ever-users compared to never- users did not have a higher all-cause or breast cancer specific-mortality, after the adjustment of risk factors.",BMC cancer,2019,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
31122807,Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer in Older Women: An Analysis of Retrospective English Cancer Registration Data.,"Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended as a treatment for women with high recurrence risk early breast cancer. Older women are less likely to receive chemotherapy than younger women. This study investigated the impact of chemotherapy on breast cancer-specific survival in women aged 70 + years using English registry data. Cancer registration data were obtained from two English regions from 2002 to 2012 (n = 29 728). The impact of patient-level characteristics on the probability of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy was explored using logistic regression. Survival modelling was undertaken to show the effect of chemotherapy and age/health status on breast cancer-specific survival. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation. In total, 11 735 surgically treated early breast cancer patients were identified. Use of adjuvant chemotherapy has increased over time. Younger age at diagnosis, increased nodal involvement, tumour size and grade, oestrogen receptor-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive disease were all associated with increased probability of receiving chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was associated with a significant reduction in the hazard of breast cancer-specific mortality in women with high risk cancer, after adjusting for patient-level characteristics (hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.67-0.81). Chemotherapy is associated with an improved breast cancer-specific survival in older women with early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence . Lower rates of chemotherapy use in older women may, therefore, contribute to inferior cancer outcomes.

30868652,Multiple imputation for discrete data: Evaluation of the joint latent normal model.,"Missing data are ubiquitous in clinical and social research, and multiple imputation (MI) is increasingly the methodology of choice for practitioners. Two principal strategies for imputation have been proposed in the literature: joint modelling multiple imputation (JM-MI) and full conditional specification multiple imputation (FCS-MI). While JM-MI is arguably a preferable approach, because it involves specification of an explicit imputation model, FCS-MI is pragmatically appealing, because of its flexibility in handling different types of variables. JM-MI has developed from the multivariate normal model, and latent normal variables have been proposed as a natural way to extend this model to handle categorical variables. In this article, we evaluate the latent normal model through an extensive simulation study and an application on data from the German Breast Cancer Study Group, comparing the results with FCS-MI. We divide our investigation in four sections, focusing on (i) binary, (ii) categorical, (iii) ordinal, and (iv) count data. Using data simulated from both the latent normal model and the general location model, we find that in all but one extreme general location model setting JM-MI works very well, and sometimes outperforms FCS-MI. We conclude the latent normal model, implemented in the R package jomo, can be used with confidence by researchers, both for single and multilevel multiple imputation.",Biometrical journal.

30633334,Progressive resistance training to prevent arm lymphedema in the first year after breast cancer surgery: Results of a randomized controlled trial.,"Existing research suggests that progressive resistance training (PRT) after breast cancer (BC) surgery is safe, but the preventive effect on arm lymphedema has yet to be determined. Women aged 18 to 75 years who were undergoing BC surgery with axillary lymph node dissection were eligible for the study. Recruited on the day of surgery, participants were allocated to intervention or usual care by computer randomization. The intervention consisted of PRT 3 times per week: in the first 20 weeks as a supervised group exercise and in the last 30 weeks as a self-administered exercise. The primary outcome was arm lymphedema, which was defined as a >3% increase in the interlimb volume difference by water displacement. Measurements were made at the baseline and at a 12-month follow-up by physiotherapists blinded to group allocation. Analyses of effects included t tests and regression models; missing data were addressed by multiple imputation. Among the 158 randomized women, no mean group difference was found in arm volume (0.3%; 95% confidence interval, -1.7% to 2.3%) or lymphedema incidence (adjusted odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-2.8). None of the participants exited the program because of adverse events. This study provides no evidence that PRT can prevent arm lymphedema in the first year after BC, but the results corroborate the importance and safety of resistance training for patients, including women at high risk for lymphedema.",Cancer,2019,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
30610561,Lessons Learned Regarding Missing Clinical Stage in the National Cancer Database.,"The National Cancer Database (NCDB) is a valuable resource for studying national cancer treatment patterns. However, data abstraction rules from 2004 to 2007 resulted in missing clinical stage for a high percentage of cases. We investigated how this missingness can bias results in breast cancer studies including patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The impact of missing clinical stage on the estimated percentage of breast cancers treated with NAC versus adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) was examined from 2004 to 2013. Trends in NAC use were presented, excluding those cases with missing clinical stage, and compared with trends after multiple imputation, performed using the chained equations approach with predictive mean matching. Clinical stage was missing for 56% of cases in 2004-2007, versus 12% in 2008-2013, and was missing more than twice as often for AC patients versus NAC patients (31% vs. 12% overall), with the largest difference occurring in 2004-2007 (60% vs. 27% missing). Because stage was more frequently missing in AC patients, excluding those missing clinical stage introduced bias when considering NAC versus AC trends. With multiple imputation, significant increases in NAC use were identified between 2004 and 2013 for each stage: use for stage I was 2% in 2004 and 5% in 2013, use for stage II was 11% in 2004 and 24% in 2013, use for stage III was 34% in 2004 and 46% in 2013, in contrast to an analysis excluding those missing stage, which suggested little or no increase within any stage. NCDB data abstraction rules from 2004 to 2007 resulted in missing clinical stage for > 50% of breast cancers, which may introduce substantial bias. Multiple imputation or exclusion of the years 2004-2007 should be considered to mitigate the problem of missing clinical stage in NCDB.",Annals of surgical oncology,2019,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
30014575,Multiple imputation in Cox regression when there are time-varying effects of covariates.,"In Cox regression, it is important to test the proportional hazards assumption and sometimes of interest in itself to study time-varying effects (TVEs) of covariates. TVEs can be investigated with log hazard ratios modelled as a function of time. Missing data on covariates are common and multiple imputation is a popular approach to handling this to avoid the potential bias and efficiency loss resulting from a ""complete-case"" analysis. Two multiple imputation methods have been proposed for when the substantive model is a Cox proportional hazards regression: an approximate method (Imputing missing covariate values for the Cox model in Statistics in Medicine (2009) by White and Royston) and a substantive-model-compatible method (Multiple imputation of covariates by fully conditional specification: accommodating the substantive model in Statistical Methods in Medical Research (2015) by Bartlett et al). At present, neither accommodates TVEs of covariates. We extend them to do so for a general form for the TVEs and give specific details for TVEs modelled using restricted cubic splines. Simulation studies assess the performance of the methods under several underlying shapes for TVEs. Our proposed methods give approximately unbiased TVE estimates for binary covariates with missing data, but for continuous covariates, the substantive-model-compatible method performs better. The methods also give approximately correct type I errors in the test for proportional hazards when there is no TVE and gain power to detect TVEs relative to complete-case analysis. Ignoring TVEs at the imputation stage results in biased TVE estimates, incorrect type I errors, and substantial loss of power in detecting TVEs. We also propose a multivariable TVE model selection algorithm. The methods are illustrated using data from the Rotterdam Breast Cancer Study.

30014030,Occupational inequalities in female cancer incidence in Japan: Hospital-based matched case-control study with occupational class.,"Socioeconomic inequalities in female cancer incidence have previously been undocumented in Japan. Using a nationwide inpatient dataset (1984-2016) in Japan, we identified 143,806 female cancer cases and 703,157 controls matched for sex, age, admission date, and admitting hospital, and performed a hospital-based matched case-control study. Based on standardized national classification, we categorized patients' socioeconomic status (SES) by occupational class (blue-collar, service, professional, manager), cross-classified by industry sector (blue-collar, service, white-collar). Using blue-collar workers in blue-collar industries as the reference group, we estimated the odds ratio (OR) for each cancer incidence using conditional logistic regression with multiple imputation, adjusted for major modifiable risk factors (smoking, alcohol consumption). We identified lower risks among higher-SES women for common and overall cancers: e.g., ORs for managers in blue-collar industries were 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.98) for stomach cancer and 0.40 (95% CI, 0.19-0.86) for lung cancer. Higher risks with higher SES were evident for breast cancer: the OR for professionals in service industries was 1.60 (95% CI, 1.29-1.98). With some cancers, homemakers showed a similar trend to subjects with higher SES; however, the magnitude of the OR was weaker than those with higher SES. Even after controlling for major modifiable risk factors, socioeconomic inequalities were evident for female cancer incidence in Japan.",SSM - population health,2018,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
29790154,Omission of surgery in older women with early breast cancer has an adverse impact on breast cancer-specific survival.,"Primary endocrine therapy is used as an alternative to surgery in up to 40 per cent of women with early breast cancer aged over 70 years in the UK. This study investigated the impact of surgery versus primary endocrine therapy on breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) in older women. Cancer registration data for 2002-2010 were obtained from two English regions. A retrospective analysis was performed for women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease, using statistical modelling to show the effect of treatment (surgery or primary endocrine therapy) and age and health status on BCSS. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation. Cancer registration data on 23 961 women were retrieved. After data preprocessing, 18 730 of 23 849 women (78·5 per cent) were identified as having ER-positive disease; of these, 10 087 (53·9 per cent) had surgery and 8643 (46·1 per cent) had primary endocrine therapy. BCSS was worse in the primary endocrine therapy group than in the surgical group (5-year BCSS rate 69·4 and 89·9 per cent respectively). This was true for all strata considered, although the difference was less in the cohort with the greatest degree of co-morbidity. For older, frailer patients the hazard of breast cancer death had less relative impact on overall survival. BCSS in older women with ER-positive disease is worse if surgery is omitted. This treatment choice may contribute to inferior cancer outcomes. Selection for surgery on the basis of predicted life expectancy may permit choice of women for whom surgery confers little benefit.",The British journal of surgery,2018,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
29717943,Cox regression analysis with missing covariates via nonparametric multiple imputation.,"We consider the situation of estimating Cox regression in which some covariates are subject to missing, and there exists additional information (including observed event time, censoring indicator and fully observed covariates) which may be predictive of the missing covariates. We propose to use two working regression models: one for predicting the missing covariates and the other for predicting the missing probabilities. For each missing covariate observation, these two working models are used to define a nearest neighbor imputing set. This set is then used to non-parametrically impute covariate values for the missing observation. Upon the completion of imputation, Cox regression is performed on the multiply imputed datasets to estimate the regression coefficients. In a simulation study, we compare the nonparametric multiple imputation approach with the augmented inverse probability weighted (AIPW) method, which directly incorporates the two working models into estimation of Cox regression, and the predictive mean matching imputation (PMM) method. We show that all approaches can reduce bias due to non-ignorable missing mechanism. The proposed nonparametric imputation method is robust to mis-specification of either one of the two working models and robust to mis-specification of the link function of the two working models. In contrast, the PMM method is sensitive to misspecification of the covariates included in imputation. The AIPW method is sensitive to the selection probability. We apply the approaches to a breast cancer dataset from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program.",Statistical methods in medical research,2019,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
29713563,Comparison of pathological characteristics between self-detected and screen-detected invasive breast cancers in Chinese women: a retrospective study.,"In China, there is insufficient evidence to support that screening programs can detect breast cancer earlier and improve outcomes compared with patient self-reporting. Therefore, we compared the pathological characteristics at diagnosis between self-detected and screen-detected cases of invasive breast cancer at our institution and determined whether these characteristics were different after the program's introduction (vs. prior to). Three databases were selected (breast cancer diagnosed in 1995-2000, 2010, and 2015), which provided a total of 3,014 female patients with invasive breast cancer. The cases were divided into self-detected and screen-detected groups. The pathological characteristics were compared between the two groups and multiple imputation and complete randomized imputation were used to deal with missing data. Compared with patient self-reporting, screening was associated with the following factors: a higher percentage of stage T1 tumors (75.0% vs 17.1%, <i>P</i> = 0.109 in 1995-2000; 66.7% vs 40.4%, <i>P</i> < 0.001 in 2010; 67.8% vs 35.7%, <i>P</i> < 0.001 in 2015); a higher percentage of tumors with stage N0 lymph node status (67.3% vs. 48.4%, <i>P</i> = 0.007 in 2010); and a higher percentage of histologic grade I tumors (22.9% vs 13.9%, <i>P</i> = 0.017 in 2010). Screen-detected breast cancer was associated with a greater number of favorable pathological characteristics. However, although screening had a beneficial role in early detection in China, we found fewer patients were detected by screening in this study compared with those in Western and Asian developed countries.",PeerJ,2018,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
29593010,Differences in Breast Cancer Survival by Molecular Subtypes in the United States.,"<b>Background:</b> Although incidence rates of breast cancer molecular subtypes are well documented, effects of molecular subtypes on breast cancer-specific survival using the largest population coverage to date are unknown in the U.S. <b>Methods:</b> Using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer registry data, we assessed survival after breast cancer diagnosis among women diagnosed during 2010 to 2013 and followed through December 31, 2014. Breast cancer molecular subtypes defined by joint hormone receptor [HR, estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR)] and HER2 status were assessed. Multiple imputation was used to fill in missing receptor status. Four-year breast cancer-specific survival per molecular subtypes and clinical/demographic factors were calculated. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate survival while controlling for clinical and demographic factors.<b>Results:</b> The best survival pattern was observed among women with HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> subtype (survival rate of 92.5% at 4 years), followed by HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>+</sup> (90.3%), HR<sup>-</sup>/HER2<sup>+</sup> (82.7%), and finally worst survival for triple-negative subtype (77.0%). Notably, failing to impute cases with missing receptor status leads to overestimation of survival because those with missing receptor status tend to have worse prognostic features. Survival differed substantially by stage at diagnosis. Among <i>de novo</i> stage IV disease, women with HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>+</sup> subtype experienced better survival than those with HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> subtype (45.5% vs. 35.9%), even after controlling for other factors.<b>Conclusions:</b> Divergence of survival curves in stage IV HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>+</sup> versus HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> subtype is likely attributable to major advances in HER2-targeted treatment.<b>Impact:</b> Contrary to conventional thought, HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>+</sup> subtype experienced better survival than HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> in advanced-stage disease. <i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 27(6); 619-26. ©2018 AACR</i>.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",2018,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
29349773,Progestin-only and combined oral contraceptives and receptor-defined premenopausal breast cancer risk: The Norwegian Women and Cancer Study.,"Receptor-defined subtypes of breast cancer represent distinct cancer types and have differences in risk factors. Whether the two main hormonal forms of oral contraceptives (OCs); i.e. progestin-only (POC) and combined oral contraceptives (COC), are differentially associated with these subtypes are not well known. The aim of our study was to assess the effect of POC and COC use on hormone receptor-defined breast cancer risk in premenopausal women in a prospective population-based cohort - The Norwegian Women and Cancer Study (NOWAC). Information on OC use was collected from 74,862 premenopausal women at baseline. Updated information was applied when follow-up information became available. Multiple imputation was performed to handle missing data, and multivariable Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for breast cancer. 1,245 incident invasive breast cancer cases occurred. POC use ≥5 years was associated with ER+ (HR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.09- 2.32, p<sub>trend</sub>  = 0.03) and ER+/PR+ cancer (HR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.07-2.48, p<sub>trend</sub>  = 0.05), and was not associated with ER- (p<sub>heterogeneity</sub>  = 0.36) or ER-/PR- (p<sub>heterogeneity</sub>  = 0.49) cancer. COC use was associated with ER- and ER-/PR- cancer, but did not increase risk of ER+ and ER+/PR+ cancer. Current COC use gave different estimates for ER/PR-defined subtypes (p<sub>heterogeneity</sub>  = 0.04). This is the first study to show significant associations between POC use and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The lack of power to distinguish effects of POC use on subtype development calls for the need of larger studies to confirm our finding.",International journal of cancer,2018,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
28615951,"Long-Term Cause-Specific Mortality After Surgery for Women With Breast Cancer: A 20-Year Follow-Up Study From Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Cancer Registries.","Research into long-term cause-specific mortality of women diagnosed with breast cancer is important because it allows for the splitting of the population into patients who eventually die from breast cancer and from other causes. The adoption of this approach helps to identify patients with an elevated risk of eventual death from breast cancer. The primary aim of this study was to examine the associations between both sociodemographic and clinicopathologic characteristics and the underlying risks of death from breast cancer and from other causes for women diagnosed with breast cancer. A second aim was to propose a predictive biomarker of cause-specific mortality in terms of treatment and several important characteristics of a patient. A cohort of 16 511 female patients diagnosed with breast cancer in 1990 was obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries and followed for 20 years. A mixture model for the regression analysis of competing risks was used to identify factors and confounders that affected either the eventual cause-specific mortality or conditional cause-specific hazard rates, or both. Missing data were handled with multiple imputation. Curvilinear relationships of age at diagnosis along with race, marital status, breast cancer type, tumor size, estrogen receptor status, extension, lymph node status, type of surgery, and radiotherapy status were significant risk factors for the cause-specific mortality, with extension and lymph node status appearing to be confounded with the effects of both type of surgery and radiotherapy status. The score obtained from combining a set of predictors showed to be an accurate predictive biomarker. In cause-specific mortality of women diagnosed breast cancer, prognosis appears to depend on both sociodemographic and clinicopathologic factors. The predictive biomarker proposed in this study may help identifying the level of seriousness of the disease earlier than traditional methods, potentially guiding future allocation of resources for better patient care and management strategies.",Breast cancer : basic and clinical research,2017,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
28474262,Multivariate model to identify women at low risk of cancer upgrade after a core needle biopsy diagnosis of atypical ductal hyperplasia.,"Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) identified on percutaneous breast biopsy represents a high-risk lesion, upgrading to cancer with surgical excision in ~7-45.8% of cases. Routine excision is questioned due to potential overtreatment and cost. This study evaluates clinical, imaging, and histologic features to predict the risk of upgrade. With IRB approval, a single-institution retrospective review was performed of patients who underwent surgical excision of ADH diagnosed by core biopsy from June 2005 to June 2013. We reviewed electronic medical records, breast imaging, and biopsy slides. Multiple imputation was used for missing data. Association of various features with cancer upgrade was assessed using logistic regression. Among 399 cases, the upgrade rate to cancer was 16.0%, (95% CI: 12.8-20.0%), with nine invasive cancers and 55 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) only. Via a logistic regression approach, we defined a subgroup with low risk for upgrade: women whose biopsies showed no individual cell necrosis, and either a) 1 focus of ADH with ≥50% removal, or b) 2-3 foci with ≥90% removal. Cases meeting these criteria had an upgrade rate of 4.9% (95% CI: 1.0-8.9%), compared to 21.4% (16.4-26.3%) in cases that did not meet this low-risk definition. ADH on core biopsy with low risk of upgrade to cancer is defined by lack of individual cell necrosis, number of foci of ADH, and percent of imaging lesion removed. If these findings are validated, women whose biopsies meet low-risk criteria might be considered for prevention therapy and surveillance without surgical excision.",Breast cancer research and treatment,2017,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
28453646,Protecting Confidentiality in Cancer Registry Data With Geographic Identifiers.,"The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program releases research files of cancer registry data. These files include geographic information at the county level, but no finer. Access to finer geography, such as census tract identifiers, would enable richer analyses-for example, examination of health disparities across neighborhoods. To date, tract identifiers have been left off the research files because they could compromise the confidentiality of patients' identities. We present an approach to inclusion of tract identifiers based on multiply imputed, synthetic data. The idea is to build a predictive model of tract locations, given patient and tumor characteristics, and randomly simulate the tract of each patient by sampling from this model. For the predictive model, we use multivariate regression trees fitted to the latitude and longitude of the population centroid of each tract. We implement the approach in the registry data from California. The method results in synthetic data that reproduce a wide range (but not all) of analyses of census tract socioeconomic cancer disparities and have relatively low disclosure risks, which we assess by comparing individual patients' actual and synthetic tract locations. We conclude with a discussion of how synthetic data sets can be used by researchers with cancer registry data.",American journal of epidemiology,2017,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"

At an early time point, the high number of censored observations can be compensated by the imputation of the unobserved deaths times. We propose to use predictions of the risk of death from a joint model for a recurrent event and a terminal event, which account for disease relapse information. Two imputation methods were compared: sampling from the estimated parametric distribution of the survival time and sampling using its nonparametric estimation. The treatment effect and its standard error were estimated via multiple imputations. The performances of the two methods were compared in terms of bias in the estimates, standard errors, and coverage probability. Both methods were then retrospectively applied to two randomized clinical trials studying the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.",Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics,2017,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
28033448,"Second Opinions From Medical Oncologists for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Prevalence, Correlates, and Consequences.","Advances in the evaluation and treatment of breast cancer have made the clinical decision-making context much more complex. A second opinion from a medical oncologist may facilitate decision making for women with breast cancer, yet little is known about second opinion use. To investigate the patterns and correlates of second opinion use and the effect on chemotherapy decisions. A total of 1901 women newly diagnosed with stages 0 to II breast cancer between July 2013 and September 2014 (response rate, 71.0%) were accrued through 2 population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries (Georgia and Los Angeles County, California) and surveyed about their experiences with medical oncologists, decision making, and chemotherapy use. Factors associated with second opinion use were evaluated using logistic regression. Also assessed was the association between second opinion and chemotherapy use, adjusting for chemotherapy indication and propensity for receiving a second opinion. Multiple imputation and weighting were used to account for missing data. A total of 1901 patients with stage I to II breast cancer (mean [SD] age, 61.6 [11.0] years; 1071 [56.3%] non-Hispanic white) saw any medical oncologist. Analysis of multiply imputed, weighted data (mean n = 1866) showed that 168 (9.8%) (SE, 0.74%) received a second opinion and 54 (3.2%) (SE, 0.47%) received chemotherapy from the second oncologist. Satisfaction with chemotherapy decisions was high and did not differ between those who did (mean [SD], 4.3 [0.08] on a 1- to 5-point scale) or did not (4.4 [0.03]) obtain a second opinion (P = .29). Predictors of second opinion use included college education vs less education (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.24-2.75), frequent use of internet-based support groups (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.12-4.11), an intermediate result on the 21-gene recurrence score assay (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.11-3.09), and a variant of uncertain significance on hereditary cancer genetic testing (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.09-9.59). After controlling for patient and tumor characteristics, second opinion use was not associated with chemotherapy receipt (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.71-1.52). Second opinion use was low (<10%) among patients with early-stage breast cancer, and high decision satisfaction regardless of second opinion use suggests little unmet demand. Along with educational level and use of internet support groups, uncertain results on genomic testing predicted second opinion use. Patient demand for second opinions may increase as more complex genomic tests are disseminated.",JAMA oncology,2017,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
27983668,Hispanic and Immigrant Paradoxes in U.S. Breast Cancer Mortality: Impact of Neighborhood Poverty and Hispanic Density.,"To test the Hispanic and Immigrant Paradoxes-i.e., survival advantages despite a worse risk factor profile-and the modifying role of neighborhood context, we examined associations between patient ethnicity, birthplace, neighborhood Hispanic density and neighborhood poverty among 166,254 female breast cancer patients diagnosed 1995-2009 in Texas, U.S. Of all, 79.9% were non-Hispanic White, 15.8% Hispanic U.S.-born, and 4.2% Hispanic foreign-born. We imputed birthplace for the 60.7% of Hispanics missing birthplace data using multiple imputation. Shared frailty Cox proportional hazard models (patients nested within census tracts) adjusted for age, diagnosis year, stage, grade, histology, urban/rural residence, and local mammography capacity. Whites (vs. U.S.-born Hispanics) had increased all-cause and breast cancer mortality. Foreign-born (vs. U.S.-born) Hispanics had increased all-cause and breast cancer mortality. Living in higher Hispanic density neighborhoods was generally associated with increased mortality, although associations differed slightly in magnitude and significance by ethnicity, birthplace, and neighborhood poverty. We found no evidence of an Immigrant Paradox and some evidence of a Hispanic Paradox where protective effects were limited to U.S.-born Hispanics. Contrary to prior studies, foreign birthplace and residence in higher Hispanic density neighborhoods were associated with increased mortality. More research on intersections between ethnicity, birthplace and neighborhood context are needed.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2016,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
27921315,Imputing estrogen receptor (ER) status in a population-based cancer registry: a sensitivity analysis.,"Breast cancers are clinically heterogeneous based on tumor markers. The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program provides baseline data on these tumor markers for reporting cancer burden and trends over time in the US general population. These tumor markers, however, are often prone to missing observations. In particular, estrogen receptor (ER) status, a key biomarker in the study of breast cancer, has been collected since 1992 but historically was not well-reported, with missingness rates as high as 25% in early years. Previous methods used to correct estimates of breast cancer incidence or ER-related odds or prevalence ratios for unknown ER status have relied on a missing-at-random (MAR) assumption. In this paper, we explore the sensitivity of these key estimates to departures from MAR. We develop a predictive mean matching procedure that can be used to multiply impute missing ER status under either an MAR or a missing not at random assumption and apply it to the SEER breast cancer data (1992-2012). The imputation procedure uses the predictive power of the rich set of covariates available in the SEER registry while also allowing us to investigate the impact of departures from MAR. We find some differences in inference under the two assumptions, although the magnitude of differences tends to be small. For the types of analyses typically of primary interest, we recommend imputing SEER breast cancer biomarkers under an MAR assumption, given the small apparent differences under MAR and missing not at random assumptions.

27892664,Breast Cancer and Modifiable Lifestyle Factors in Argentinean Women: Addressing Missing Data in a Case-Control Study.,"A number of studies have evidenced the effect of modifiable lifestyle factors such as diet, breastfeeding and nutritional status on breast cancer risk. However, none have addressed the missing data problem in nutritional epidemiologic research in South America. Missing data is a frequent problem in breast cancer studies and epidemiological settings in general. Estimates of effect obtained from these studies may be biased, if no appropriate method for handling missing data is applied. We performed Multiple Imputation for missing values on covariates in a breast cancer case-control study of Córdoba (Argentina) to optimize risk estimates. Data was obtained from a breast cancer case control study from 2008 to 2015 (318 cases, 526 controls). Complete case analysis and multiple imputation using chained equations were the methods applied to estimate the effects of a Traditional dietary pattern and other recognized factors associated with breast cancer. Physical activity and socioeconomic status were imputed. Logistic regression models were performed. When complete case analysis was performed only 31% of women were considered. Although a positive association of Traditional dietary pattern and breast cancer was observed from both approaches (complete case analysis OR=1.3, 95%CI=1.0-1.7; multiple imputation OR=1.4, 95%CI=1.2-1.7), effects of other covariates, like BMI and breastfeeding, were only identified when multiple imputation was considered. A Traditional dietary pattern, BMI and breastfeeding are associated with the occurrence of breast cancer in this Argentinean population when multiple imputation is appropriately performed. Multiple Imputation is suggested in Latin America’s epidemiologic studies to optimize effect estimates in the future.",Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2016,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
27498099,How do different delivery schedules of tailored web-based physical activity advice for breast cancer survivors influence intervention use and efficacy?,"The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of differing delivery schedules of computer-tailored physical activity modules on engagement and physical activity behaviour change in a web-based intervention targeting breast cancer survivors. Insufficiently active breast cancer survivors (n = 492) were randomly assigned to receive one of the following intervention schedules over 12 weeks: a three-module intervention delivered monthly, a three-module intervention delivered weekly or a single module intervention. Engagement with the website (number of logins, time on site, modules viewed, action plans completed) was measured using tracking software. Other outcomes (website acceptability, physical activity behaviour) were assessed using online surveys. Physical activity outcomes were analysed using regression models for both study completers and when applying intention-to-treat (using multiple imputation). Completers allocated to the monthly module group rated the intervention higher (b = 2.2 95 % CI = 0.02-4.53) on acceptability and had higher levels of resistance-training (IRR = 1.88, 95 % CI = 1.16-3.04) than those in the single module group. When accounting for missing data, these differences were no longer significant. The completion of at least two action plans was higher among those allocated to the monthly module group compared to those in the weekly module group (53 vs 40 %, p = 0.02); though the completion of at least two modules was higher in the weekly module group compared to the monthly module group (60 vs 46 %; p = 0.01). There were no other significant between group differences observed. This study provides preliminary evidence that web-based computer-tailored interventions can be used to increase physical activity among breast cancer survivors. Further, there were some outcome differences based on how the tailored modules were delivered, with the most favourable outcomes observed in the monthly delivery group. This study will be useful for informing the design of future web-based interventions targeting breast cancer survivors.",Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,2017,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
27470937,Trends in advanced breast cancer incidence rates after implementation of a mammography screening program in a German population.,"Mammography screening programs (MSPs) aim to detect early-stage breast cancers in order to decrease the incidence of advanced-stage breast cancers and to reduce breast cancer mortality. We analyzed the time trends of advanced-stage breast cancer incidence rates in the target population before and after implementation of the MSP in a region of northwestern Germany. The MSP in the Münster district started in October 2005. A total of 13,874 women with an incident invasive breast cancer (BC) was identified by the population-based epidemiological cancer registry between 2000 and 2013 in the target group 50-69 years. Multiple imputation methods were used to replace missing data on tumor stages (10.4%). The incidence rates for early-stage (UICC I) and advanced-stage (UICC II+) BC were determined, and Poisson regression analyses were performed to assess trends over time. The incidence rates for UICC I breast cancers increased during the step-up introduction of the MSP and remained elevated thereafter. By contrast, after increasing from 2006 to 2008, the incidence rates of UICC II+ breast cancers decreased to levels below the pre-screening period. Significantly decreasing UICC II+ incidence rates were limited to the age group 55-69 years and reached levels that were significantly lower than incidence rates in the pre-screening period. The incidence rates of advanced-stage breast cancers decreased in the age groups from 55 years to the upper age limit for screening eligibility, but not in the adjacent age groups. The findings are consistent with MSP lead time effects and seem to indicate that the MSP lowers advanced-stage breast cancer rates in the target population.",Cancer epidemiology,2016,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
27344114,10 year survival after breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy compared with mastectomy in early breast cancer in the Netherlands: a population-based study.,"Investigators of registry-based studies report improved survival for breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy compared with mastectomy in early breast cancer. As these studies did not present long-term overall and breast cancer-specific survival, the effect of breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy might be overestimated. In this study, we aimed to evaluate 10 year overall and breast cancer-specific survival after breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy compared with mastectomy in Dutch women with early breast cancer. In this population-based study, we selected all women from the Netherlands Cancer Registry diagnosed with primary, invasive, stage T1-2, N0-1, M0 breast cancer between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2004, given either breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy or mastectomy, irrespective of axillary staging or dissection or use of adjuvant systemic therapy. Primary outcomes were 10 year overall survival in the entire cohort and breast cancer-specific survival in a representative subcohort of patients diagnosed in 2003 with characteristics similar to the entire cohort. We estimated breast cancer-specific survival by calculating distant metastasis-free and relative survival for every tumour and nodal category. We did multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for overall and distant metastasis-free survival. We estimated relative survival by calculating excess mortality ratios using life tables of the general population. We did multiple imputation to account for missing data. Of the 37 207 patients included in this study, 21 734 (58%) received breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy and 15 473 (42%) received mastectomy. The 2003 representative subcohort consisted of 7552 (20%) patients, of whom 4647 (62%) received breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy and 2905 (38%) received mastectomy. For both unadjusted and adjusted analysis accounting for various confounding factors, breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy was significantly associated with improved 10 year overall survival in the whole cohort overall compared with mastectomy (HR 0·51 [95% CI 0·49-0·53]; p<0·0001; adjusted HR 0·81 [0·78-0·85]; p<0·0001), and this improvement remained significant for all subgroups of different T and N stages of breast cancer. After adjustment for confounding variables, breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy did not significantly improve 10 year distant metastasis-free survival in the 2003 cohort overall compared with mastectomy (adjusted HR 0·88 [0·77-1·01]; p=0·07), but did in the T1N0 subgroup (adjusted 0·74 [0·58-0·94]; p=0·014). Breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy did significantly improve 10 year relative survival in the 2003 cohort overall (adjusted 0·76 [0·64-0·91]; p=0·003) and in the T1N0 subgroup (adjusted 0·60 [0·42-0·85]; p=0·004) compared with mastectomy. Adjusting for confounding variables, breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy showed improved 10 year overall and relative survival compared with mastectomy in early breast cancer, but 10 year distant metastasis-free survival was improved with breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy compared with mastectomy in the T1N0 subgroup only, indicating a possible role of confounding by severity. These results suggest that breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy is at least equivalent to mastectomy with respect to overall survival and may influence treatment decision making for patients with early breast cancer.

26825007,"The use of surgery in the treatment of ER+ early stage breast cancer in England: Variation by time, age and patient characteristics.","To assess whether the proportion of patients aged 70 and over with ER+ operable breast cancer in England who are treated with surgery has changed since 2002, and to determine whether age and individual level factors including tumour characteristics and co-morbidity influence treatment choice. A retrospective cohort analysis of routinely collected cancer registration data from two English regions (West Midlands, Northern & Yorkshire) was carried out (n = 17,129). Trends in surgical use over time for different age groups were assessed graphically and with linear regression. Uni- and multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess the effects of age, comorbidity, deprivation and disease characteristics on treatment choice. Missing data was handled using multiple imputation. There is no evidence of a change in the proportion of patients treated surgically over time. The multivariable model shows that age remains an important predictor of whether or not a woman with ER+ operable breast cancer receives surgery after covariate adjustment (Odds ratio of surgery vs no surgery, 0.82 (per year over 70)). Co-morbidity, deprivation, symptomatic presentation, later stage at diagnosis and low grade are also associated with increased probability of non-surgical treatment. Contrary to current NICE guidance in England, age appears to be an important factor in the decision to treat operable ER+ breast cancer non-surgically. Further research is needed to assess the role of other age-related factors on treatment choice, and the effect that current practice has on survival and mortality from breast cancer for older women.",European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology,2016,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"

Potential bias due to selective non-response may disrupt associations being investigated. We describe the design of a Finnish population-based study on associations between breast cancer screening and various indicators for lifestyle and quality of life, and evaluate the level of bias among the respondents from the first study rounds over 2 years. The study target population of 10,000, 49-year-old women was randomly drawn from the Finnish National Population Registry.

Questionnaires focusing on lifestyle-related risk factors and quality of life were sent to the target population in 2012-13, 1 year before the first invitation to organized breast cancer screening. We evaluated associations between willingness to respond and demographic characteristics in the eligible study population. Additionally, we examined associations between the demographic characteristics and the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and evaluated the impact of non-response using inverse probability weighting and multiple imputation. The questionnaire response proportion was 52.4%. Compared to non-respondents, respondents were more often married, academically educated, and native speakers of Finnish or Swedish. Nevertheless, the estimates of the SWLS among the respondents were in line with those corrected by non-response in the eligible study population.

26434910,Survival Prognostic Factors of Male Breast Cancer in Southern Iran: a LASSO-Cox Regression Approach.,"We used to LASSO-Cox method for determining prognostic factors of male breast cancer survival and showed the superiority of this method compared to Cox proportional hazard model in low sample size setting. In order to identify and estimate exactly the relative hazard of the most important factors effective for the survival duration of male breast cancer, the LASSO-Cox method has been used. Our data includes the information of male breast cancer patients in Fars province, south of Iran, from 1989 to 2008. Cox proportional hazard and LASSO-Cox models were fitted for 20 classified variables. To reduce the impact of missing data, the multiple imputation method was used 20 times through the Markov chain Mont Carlo method and the results were combined with Rubin's rules. In 50 patients, the age at diagnosis was 59.6 (SD=12.8) years with a minimum of 34 and maximum of 84 years and the mean of survival time was 62 months. Three, 5 and 10 year survival were 92%, 77% and 26%, respectively. Using the LASSO-Cox method led to eliminating 8 low effect variables and also decreased the standard error by 2.5 to 7 times. The relative efficiency of LASSO-Cox method compared with the Cox proportional hazard method was calculated as 22.39. The19 years follow of male breast cancer patients show that the age, having a history of alcohol use, nipple discharge, laterality, histological grade and duration of symptoms were the most important variables that have played an effective role in the patient's survival. In such situations, estimating the coefficients by LASSO-Cox method will be more efficient than the Cox's proportional hazard method.",Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2015,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"

A randomized pragmatic trial with two parallel arms was performed. Women with confirmed diagnoses of breast cancer were randomized (stratified by usual care treatment) to receive individualized complementary medicine (CM group) or usual care alone (usual care group). Both groups were allowed to use conventional treatment for breast cancer. Primary endpoint was the breast cancer-related quality of life FACT-B score at 6 months. For statistical analysis, we used analysis of covariance (with factors treatment, stratum, and baseline FACT-B score) and imputed missing FACT-B scores at 6 months with regression-based multiple imputation. A total of 275 patients were randomized between April 2011 and March 2012 to the CM group (n = 136, 56.3 ± 10.9 years of age) or the usual care group (n = 139, 56.0 ± 11.0). After 6 months from randomization, adjusted means for health-related quality of life were higher in the CM group (FACT-B score 107.9; 95 % CI 104.1-111.7) compared to the usual care group (102.2; 98.5-105.9) with an adjusted FACT-B score difference between groups of 5.7 (2.6-8.7, p < 0.001). Thus, an additional individualized and complex complementary medicine intervention improved quality of life of breast cancer patients compared to usual care alone.

25304447,Statin use after diagnosis of breast cancer and survival: a population-based cohort study.,"Preclinical studies have shown that statins, particularly simvastatin, can prevent growth in breast cancer cell lines and animal models. We investigated whether statins used after breast cancer diagnosis reduced the risk of breast cancer-specific, or all-cause, mortality in a large cohort of breast cancer patients. A cohort of 17,880 breast cancer patients, newly diagnosed between 1998 and 2009, was identified from English cancer registries (from the National Cancer Data Repository). This cohort was linked to the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, providing prescription records, and to the Office of National Statistics mortality data (up to 2013), identifying 3694 deaths, including 1469 deaths attributable to breast cancer. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for breast cancer-specific, and all-cause, mortality in statin users after breast cancer diagnosis were calculated using time-dependent Cox regression models. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using multiple imputation methods, propensity score methods and a case-control approach. There was some evidence that statin use after a diagnosis of breast cancer had reduced mortality due to breast cancer and all causes (fully adjusted HR = 0.84 [95% confidence interval = 0.68-1.04] and 0.84 [0.72-0.97], respectively). These associations were more marked for simvastatin 0.79 (0.63-1.00) and 0.81 (0.70-0.95), respectively. In this large population-based breast cancer cohort, there was some evidence of reduced mortality in statin users after breast cancer diagnosis.

Population-based estimates of contralateral breast cancer (CBC) incidence by HR subtype in particular are limited. The aim of this study was to provide detailed data on CBC incidence for Germany. Invasive breast cancer data were extracted on 49,804 women yielding 594 second primaries from the cancer registries of the Federal States of Brandenburg and Saarland and the area of Munich for the period from 1998 to 2007. Multiple imputation was used on missing values for HR status. We estimated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). SIR estimates of CBC among women diagnosed with an invasive first primary breast cancer (FBC) of any HR subtype ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 in the three registries. Pooling three registries' data, the SIR of HR-positive CBC was 0.7 (95%CI: 0.6 to 0.8) among women with HR-positive FBC. For those women with HR-negative FBC, the SIR of HR-negative CBC was 8.9 (95%CI: 7.1 to 11.1). Among women with FBC diagnosed before the age of 50 years, incidence of CBC was increased, especially for HR-negative FBC (SIR: 9.2; 95%CI: 7.1 to 11.9).

We examine the limiting behaviour of estimators arising from inverse probability weighted estimating equations, augmented inverse probability weighted estimating equations and multiple imputation when the requisite auxiliary models are misspecified. We compute limiting values for settings involving binary responses and covariates and illustrate the effects of model misspecification using simulations based on data from a breast cancer clinical trial. We demonstrate that, even when both auxiliary models are misspecified, the asymptotic biases of double-robust augmented inverse probability weighted estimators are often smaller than the asymptotic biases of estimators arising from complete-case analyses, inverse probability weighting or multiple imputation. We further demonstrate that use of inverse probability weighting or multiple imputation with slightly misspecified auxiliary models can actually result in greater asymptotic bias than the use of naïve, complete case analyses. These asymptotic results are shown to be consistent with empirical results from simulation studies.",Statistical methods in medical research,2017,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"

To investigate this association and the potential of tumour T-cell infiltration as a prognostic and predictive marker, we have conducted the largest study of T cells in breast cancer to date. Four studies totalling 12 439 patients were used for this work. Cytotoxic (CD8+) and regulatory (forkhead box protein 3, FOXP3+) T cells were quantified using immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC for CD8 was conducted using available material from all four studies (8978 samples) and for FOXP3 from three studies (5239 samples)-multiple imputation was used to resolve missing data from the remaining patients. Cox regression was used to test for associations with breast cancer-specific survival. In ER-negative tumours [triple-negative breast cancer and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive)], presence of CD8+ T cells within the tumour was associated with a 28% [95% confidence interval (CI) 16% to 38%] reduction in the hazard of breast cancer-specific mortality, and CD8+ T cells within the stroma with a 21% (95% CI 7% to 33%) reduction in hazard. In ER-positive HER2-positive tumours, CD8+ T cells within the tumour were associated with a 27% (95% CI 4% to 44%) reduction in hazard. In ER-negative disease, there was evidence for greater benefit from anthracyclines in the National Epirubicin Adjuvant Trial in patients with CD8+ tumours [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.54; 95% CI 0.37-0.79] versus CD8-negative tumours (HR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.55-1.38). The difference in effect between these subgroups was significant when limited to cases with complete data (P heterogeneity = 0.04) and approached significance in imputed data (P heterogeneity = 0.1). The presence of CD8+ T cells in breast cancer is associated with a significant reduction in the relative risk of death from disease in both the ER-negative [supplementary Figure S1, available at Annals of Oncology online] and the ER-positive HER2-positive subtypes. Tumour lymphocytic infiltration may improve risk stratification in breast cancer patients classified into these subtypes.

24003037,"Hormone replacement therapy and breast cancer: heterogeneous risks by race, weight, and breast density.","Although studies have demonstrated a positive association between hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and breast cancer risk, this association may vary by patient factors. We analyzed 1642824 screening mammograms with 9300 breast cancer cases in postmenopausal women aged 45 years or older derived from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, a longitudinal registry of mammography screening in the United States. Multiple imputation methods were used to accommodate missing data for HRT use (14%) and other covariables. We performed logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for breast cancer associated with HRT use within strata of race/ethnicity, age, body mass index (BMI), and breast density, with two-way interaction terms between HRT use and each key covariable of interest. P values for assessing possible interactions were computed from Wald z statistics. All statistical tests were two-sided. HRT use was associated with greater than 20% increased risk in white (OR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.14 to 1.28), Asian (OR = 1.58; 95% CI = 1.18 to 2.11), and Hispanic women (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.67) but not black women (OR = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.72 to 1.14; P interaction = .04). In women with low/normal BMI and extremely dense breasts, HRT use was associated with the highest breast cancer risk (OR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.21 to 1.83), compared with nonusers. In overweight/obese women with less-dense breasts, no excess risk was associated with HRT use (adjusted ORs = 0.96 to 1.03). The impact of HRT use on breast cancer risk varies according to race/ethnicity, BMI, and breast density. This risk stratification could help in advising HRT use for the relief of menopausal symptoms.",Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2013,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
23919666,Imputation method for lifetime exposure assessment in air pollution epidemiologic studies.,"Environmental epidemiology, when focused on the life course of exposure to a specific pollutant, requires historical exposure estimates that are difficult to obtain for the full time period due to gaps in the historical record, especially in earlier years. We show that these gaps can be filled by applying multiple imputation methods to a formal risk equation that incorporates lifetime exposure. We also address challenges that arise, including choice of imputation method, potential bias in regression coefficients, and uncertainty in age-at-exposure sensitivities. During time periods when parameters needed in the risk equation are missing for an individual, the parameters are filled by an imputation model using group level information or interpolation. A random component is added to match the variance found in the estimates for study subjects not needing imputation. The process is repeated to obtain multiple data sets, whose regressions against health data can be combined statistically to develop confidence limits using Rubin's rules to account for the uncertainty introduced by the imputations. To test for possible recall bias between cases and controls, which can occur when historical residence location is obtained by interview, and which can lead to misclassification of imputed exposure by disease status, we introduce an ""incompleteness index,"" equal to the percentage of dose imputed (PDI) for a subject. ""Effective doses"" can be computed using different functional dependencies of relative risk on age of exposure, allowing intercomparison of different risk models. To illustrate our approach, we quantify lifetime exposure (dose) from traffic air pollution in an established case-control study on Long Island, New York, where considerable in-migration occurred over a period of many decades. The major result is the described approach to imputation. The illustrative example revealed potential recall bias, suggesting that regressions against health data should be done as a function of PDI to check for consistency of results. The 1% of study subjects who lived for long durations near heavily trafficked intersections, had very high cumulative exposures. Thus, imputation methods must be designed to reproduce non-standard distributions. Our approach meets a number of methodological challenges to extending historical exposure reconstruction over a lifetime and shows promise for environmental epidemiology. Application to assessment of breast cancer risks will be reported in a subsequent manuscript.",Environmental health : a global access science source,2013,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"

While nonresponse to the manifest items is a common complication, inferences of LCR can be evaluated using maximum likelihood, multiple imputation, and two-stage multiple imputation. Under similar missing data assumptions, the estimates and variances from all three procedures are quite close. However, multiple imputation and two-stage multiple imputation can provide additional information: estimates for the rates of missing information.

23653257,Regression modeling of the cumulative incidence function with missing causes of failure using pseudo-values.,"Competing risks arise when patients may fail from several causes. Strategies for modeling event-specific quantities often assume that the cause of failure is known for all patients, but this is seldom the case. Several authors have addressed the problem of modeling the cause-specific hazard rates with missing causes of failure. In contrast, direct modeling of the cumulative incidence function has received little attention.We provide a general framework for regression modeling of this function in the missing cause setting, encompassing key models such as the Fine and Gray and additive models, by considering two extensions of the Andersen–Klein pseudo-value approach. The first extension is a novel inverse probability weighting method, whereas the second extension is based on a previously proposed multiple imputation procedure.We evaluated the gain in using these approaches with small samples in an extensive simulation study. We analyzed the data from an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group breast cancer treatment clinical trial to illustrate the practical value and ease of implementation of the proposed methods.",Statistics in medicine,2013,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
23338788,Exploring the association between genetic variation in the SUMO isopeptidase gene USPL1 and breast cancer through integration of data from the population-based GENICA study and external genetic databases.,"Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins are covalently attached to target proteins to modify their function. SUMO conjugation participates in processes tightly linked to tumorigenesis. Recently USPL1 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase-like (1) was identified as a SUMO isopeptidase. We report here on the first exploratory study investigating the relationship between genetic variability in USPL1 and breast cancer. Three potentially functional nonsynonymous coding SNPs (rs3742303, rs17609459, rs7984952) were genotyped in 1,021 breast cancer cases and 1,015 controls from the population-based GENICA study. We took advantage of multiple genotype imputation based on HapMap and the 1000 Genomes Project data to refine the association screening in the investigated region. Public genetic databases were also used to investigate the relationship with USPL1 expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines and breast tissue. Women homozygous for the minor C allele of rs7984952 showed a lower risk of Grade 3 breast tumors compared to TT homozygotes (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30-0.81). Case-only analyses confirmed the association between rs7984952 and tumor grade (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39-0.93). Imputation results in a 238 kb region around rs7984952 based on HapMap and the 1000 Genomes Project data were similar. No imputed variant showed an association signal stronger than rs7984952. USPL1 expression in tumor breast tissue increased with the number of C alleles. The present study illustrates the contribution of multiple imputation of genotypes using public data repositories to standard genotyping laboratory. The provided information may facilitate the design of independent studies to validate the association between USPL1 rs7984952 and risk of Grade 3 breast tumors.",International journal of cancer,2013,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
23113185,Assessment of Internal Validity of Prognostic Models through Bootstrapping and Multiple Imputation of Missing Data.,"Prognostic models have clinical appeal to aid therapeutic decision making. Two main practical challenges in development of such models are assessment of validity of models and imputation of missing data. In this study, importance of imputation of missing data and application of bootstrap technique in development, simplification, and assessment of internal validity of a prognostic model is highlighted. Overall, 310 breast cancer patients were recruited. Missing data were imputed 10 times. Then to deal with sensitivity of the model due to small changes in the data (internal validity), 100 bootstrap samples were drawn from each of 10 imputed data sets leading to 1000 samples. A Cox regression model was fitted to each of 1000 samples. Only variables retained in more than 50% of samples were used in development of final model. Four variables retained significant in more than 50% (i.e. 500 samples) of bootstrap samples; tumour size (91%), tumour grade (64%), history of benign breast disease (77%), and age at diagnosis (59%). Tumour size was the strongest predictor with inclusion frequency exceeding 90%. Number of deliveries was correlated with age at diagnosis (r=0.35, P<0.001). These two variables together retained significant in more than 90% of samples. We addressed two important methodological issues using a cohort of breast cancer patients. The algorithm combines multiple imputation of missing data and bootstrapping and has the potential to be applied in all kind of regression modelling exercises so as to address internal validity of models.",Iranian journal of public health,2012,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
22785007,Population-based hormone receptor-specific incidence trends of breast cancer in Germany.,"Several countries reported a drop in prescription of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the 2000s, followed by decreases in breast cancer incidence among postmenopausal women aged 50-69 years. The aim of this study was to provide hormone receptor specific incidence rates of breast cancer in Germany. Breast cancer data were extracted from the cancer registries of the Federal States of Brandenburg and Saarland and the area of Munich for the period from 1998 to 2007. We obtained nationwide data on HRT prescription in 1998-2007 from health insurances. Multiple imputation was used on missing values for the receptor status. Age-standardized (European standard population) and age-specific rates were calculated. The age-standardized incidence rates in breast cancer were virtually constant over the entire period in all regions. In particular, no substantial changes over time occurred within the age- and receptor-specific analyses. In the same period we observed a drop in HRT use, starting in 1999 and leveling off in 2004. The incidence trends of carcinoma in situ of the female breast increased during the study period. In our data, we did not observe an association between the decline in HRT prescription and breast cancer incidence among women aged from 50 to 69 years. The lack of temporal changes in breast cancer incidence may be explained by introduction of opportunistic and organized mammography screening and low absolute levels of HRT prescription in Germany.",Maturitas,2012,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
22737525,Multiple imputation in survival models: applied on breast cancer data.,"Missing data is a common problem in cancer research. While simple methods such as completecase (C-C) analysis are commonly employed for handling this problem, several studies have shown that these methods led to biased estimates. We aim to address the methodological issues in development of a prognostic model with missing data. Three hundred and ten breast cancer patients were enrolled. At first, patients with missing data on any of four candidate variables were omitted. Secondly, missing data were imputed 10 times. Cox regression model was fitted to the C-C and imputed data. Results were compared in terms of variables retained in the model, discrimination ability, and goodness of fit. Some variables lost their effect in complete-case analysis, due to loss in power, but reached significance level after imputation of missing data. Discrimination ability and goodness of fit of imputed data sets model was higher than that of complete-case model (C-index 76% versus 72%; Likelihood Ratio Test 51.19 versus 32.44). Our findings showed inappropriateness of ad hoc complete-case analysis. This approach led to loss in power and imprecise estimates. Application of multiple imputation techniques to avid such problems is recommended.",Iranian Red Crescent medical journal,2011,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
22614985,Patient and physician decision styles and breast cancer chemotherapy use in older women: Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocol 369901.,"PURPOSE Physician and patient decision styles may influence breast cancer care for patients ≥ 65 years (""older"") because there is uncertainty about chemotherapy benefits in this group. We evaluate associations between decision-making styles and actual treatment. METHODS Data were collected from women treated outside of clinical trials for newly diagnosed stage I to III breast cancer (83% response) from January 2004 through April 2011 in 75 cooperative group sites. Physicians completed a one-time mailed survey (91% response), and clinical data were abstracted from charts. Patient decision style was measured on a five-point scale. Oncologists' preference for prescribing chemotherapy was based on standardized vignettes. Regression and multiple imputation were used to assess associations between chemotherapy and other variables. Results There were 1,174 women seen by 212 oncologists; 43% of women received chemotherapy. One-third of women preferred to make their own treatment decision. Patient and physician decision styles were independently associated with chemotherapy. Women who preferred less physician input had lower odds of chemotherapy than women who preferred more input (odds ratio [OR] = 0.79 per 1-point change; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97; P = .02) after considering covariates. Patients whose oncologists had a high chemotherapy preference had higher odds of receiving chemotherapy (OR = 2.65; 95% CI, 1.80 to 3.89; P < .001) than those who saw oncologists with a low preference. CONCLUSION Physicians' and older patients' decision styles are each associated with breast cancer chemotherapy use. It will be important to re-evaluate the impact of decision styles when there is greater empirical evidence about the benefits and risks of chemotherapy in older patients.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2012,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
22538974,Aurora kinase A outperforms Ki67 as a prognostic marker in ER-positive breast cancer.,"Proliferation has emerged as a major prognostic factor in luminal breast cancer. The immunohistochemical (IHC) proliferation marker Ki67 has been most extensively investigated but has not gained widespread clinical acceptance. We have conducted a head-to-head comparison of a panel of proliferation markers, including Ki67. Our aim was to establish the marker of the greatest prognostic utility. Tumour samples from 3093 women with breast cancer were constructed as tissue microarrays. We used IHC to detect expression of mini-chromosome maintenance protein 2, Ki67, aurora kinase A (AURKA), polo-like kinase 1, geminin and phospho-histone H3. We used a Cox proportional-hazards model to investigate the association with 10-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Missing values were resolved using multiple imputation. The prognostic significance of proliferation was limited to oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Aurora kinase A emerged as the marker of the greatest prognostic significance in a multivariate model adjusted for the standard clinical and molecular covariates (hazard ratio 1.3; 95% confidence interval 1.1-1.5; P=0.005), outperforming all other markers including Ki67. Aurora kinase A outperforms other proliferation markers as an independent predictor of BCSS in ER-positive breast cancer.

22337708,Mammographic density and urbanization: a population-based screening study.,"The high incidence of female breast cancer that has been consistently reported in urban areas could be mediated by breast density, which is considered to reflect the cumulative exposure of breast tissues to hormones. The aim of this study was to assess how mammographic density varies by the degree of urbanization. The population consisted of 55,597 cancer-free women, aged 50-59 years, who participated in a French breast cancer screening programme (Franche-Comté region) between 2005 and 2009. Ordered logistic regression was run with mammographic density as the outcome, and degree of urbanization as the independent variable, while adjusting for some known confounding factors. Multiple imputation was used to deal with missing data. A significant positive linear trend with urbanization was found in a univariate approach (P trend <10(-3)), and after adjusting for risk factors (P trend = 10(-3)). A negative and highly significant association with mammographic density was highlighted both for age at the time of mammography (odds ratio (OR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-0.43, per 10 years), and for low socioeconomic status (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.67-0.75). The OR for hormone replacement therapy use was 1.51 (95% CI 1.43-1.58). Knowledge of this urbanization gradient in density (whatever its mechanism) may help to identify women who may require full-field digital mammography for the early detection of breast cancer, and could assist primary care providers in recommending the best screening strategy in a risk factor-based approach.",Journal of medical screening,2012,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
22179822,Vertical modelling: Analysis of competing risks data with missing causes of failure.,"We propose vertical modelling as a natural approach to the problem of analysis of competing risks data when failure types are missing for some individuals. Under a natural missing-at-random assumption for these missing failure types, we use the observed data likelihood to estimate its parameters and show that the all-cause hazard and the relative hazards appearing in vertical modelling are indeed key quantities of this likelihood. This fact has practical implications in that it suggests vertical modelling as a simple and attractive method of analysis in competing risks with missing causes of failure; all individuals are used in estimating the all-cause hazard and only those with non-missing cause of failure for relative hazards. The relative hazards also appear in a multiple imputation approach to the same problem proposed by Lu and Tsiatis and in the EM algorithm. We compare the vertical modelling approach with the method of Goetghebeur and Ryan for a breast cancer data set, highlighting the different aspects they contribute to the data analysis.",Statistical methods in medical research,2015,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
22028204,Multiple imputation methods for inference on cumulative incidence with missing cause of failure.,"Analysis of cumulative incidence (sometimes called absolute risk or crude risk) can be difficult if the cause of failure is missing for some subjects. Assuming missingness is random conditional on the observed data, we develop asymptotic theory for multiple imputation methods to estimate cumulative incidence. Covariates affect cause-specific hazards in our model, and we assume that separate proportional hazards models hold for each cause-specific hazard. Simulation studies show that procedures based on asymptotic theory have near nominal operating characteristics in cohorts of 200 and 400 subjects, both for cumulative incidence and for prediction error. The methods are illustrated with data on survival after breast cancer, obtained from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP).",Biometrical journal.

22025134,Comparison of six statistics of genetic association regarding their ability to discriminate between causal variants and genetically linked markers.,"Genome-wide association (GWA) studies still rely on the common-disease common-variant hypothesis since the assumption is associated with increased power. In GWA studies, polymorphisms are genotyped and their association with disease is investigated. Most of the identified associations are indirect and reflect a shared inheritance of the genotyped markers and genetically linked causal variants. We have compared six statistics of genetic association regarding their ability to discriminate between markers and causal susceptibility variants, including a probability value (Pval) and a Bayes Factor (BF) based on logistic regression, and the attributable familial relative risk (FRR). We carried out a simulation-based sensitivity analysis to explore several conceivable scenarios. Theoretical results were illustrated by established causal associations with age-related macular degeneration and by using imputed data based on HapMap for a case-control study of breast cancer. Our data indicate that a representation of genetic association by FRRs and BFs generally facilitates the distinction of causal variants. The FRR showed the best discriminative power under most investigated scenarios, but no single statistic outperformed the others in all situations. For example, rare moderate- to low-penetrance variants (allele frequency: 1%, dominant odds ratio: ≤2.0) seem to be best discriminated by BFs. Present results may help to fully utilize the data generated in association studies that take advantage of next generation sequencing and/or multiple imputation based on the 1000 Genomes Project.",Human heredity,2011,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
21953021,A Ki67/BCL2 index based on immunohistochemistry is highly prognostic in ER-positive breast cancer.,"There is an urgent need to improve prognostic classifiers in breast cancer. Ki67 and B-cell lymphoma 2 protein (BCL2) are established prognostic markers which have traditionally been assessed separately, in a dichotomous manner. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that combinatorial assessment of these markers would provide superior prognostic information and improve their clinical utility. Tissue microarrays were used to assess the expression of Ki67 and BCL2 in 2749 cases of invasive breast cancer. We devised a Ki67/BCL2 index representing the relative expression of each protein and assessed its association with breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) using a Cox proportional-hazards model. Based on our findings, an independent cohort of 3992 cases was used to validate the prognostic significance of the Ki67/BCL2 index. All survival analyses were conducted on complete data as well as data where missing values were resolved using multiple imputation. This study complied with reporting recommendations for tumour marker prognostic studies (REMARK) criteria. The Ki67/BCL2 index showed a significant association with BCSS at 10 years in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease. In multivariate analysis, adjusting for major clinical and molecular markers, the Ki67/BCL2 index retained prognostic significance, robustly classifying cases into three risk groups [intermediate- versus low-risk hazard ratio (HR), 1.5; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.0-2.0; p = 0.031; high- versus low-risk HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.0; p = 0.005]. This finding was validated in an independent cohort of 3992 tumours containing 2761 ER-positive tumours (intermediate- versus low-risk HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.1; p < 0.001; high- versus low-risk HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.9; p < 0.001). Ki67 and BCL2 can be effectively combined to produce an index which is an independent predictor of BCSS in ER-positive breast cancer, enhancing their potential prognostic utility.",The Journal of pathology,2012,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
21929796,Imputation of missing values of tumour stage in population-based cancer registration.,"Missing data on tumour stage information is a common problem in population-based cancer registries. Statistical analyses on the level of tumour stage may be biased, if no adequate method for handling of missing data is applied. In order to determine a useful way to treat missing data on tumour stage, we examined different imputation models for multiple imputation with chained equations for analysing the stage-specific numbers of cases of malignant melanoma and female breast cancer. This analysis was based on the malignant melanoma data set and the female breast cancer data set of the cancer registry Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. The cases with complete tumour stage information were extracted and their stage information partly removed according to a MAR missingness-pattern, resulting in five simulated data sets for each cancer entity. The missing tumour stage values were then treated with multiple imputation with chained equations, using polytomous regression, predictive mean matching, random forests and proportional sampling as imputation models. The estimated tumour stages, stage-specific numbers of cases and survival curves after multiple imputation were compared to the observed ones. The amount of missing values for malignant melanoma was too high to estimate a reasonable number of cases for each UICC stage. However, multiple imputation of missing stage values led to stage-specific numbers of cases of T-stage for malignant melanoma as well as T- and UICC-stage for breast cancer close to the observed numbers of cases. The observed tumour stages on the individual level, the stage-specific numbers of cases and the observed survival curves were best met with polytomous regression or predictive mean matching but not with random forest or proportional sampling as imputation models. This limited simulation study indicates that multiple imputation with chained equations is an appropriate technique for dealing with missing information on tumour stage in population-based cancer registries, if the amount of unstaged cases is on a reasonable level.",BMC medical research methodology,2011,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
21560139,Multiple imputation based on restricted mean model for censored data.,"Most multiple imputation (MI) methods for censored survival data either ignore patient characteristics when imputing a likely event time, or place quite restrictive modeling assumptions on the survival distributions used for imputation. In this research, we propose a robust MI approach that directly imputes restricted lifetimes over the study period based on a model of the mean restricted life as a linear function of covariates. This method has the advantages of retaining patient characteristics when making imputation choices through the restricted mean parameters and does not make assumptions on the shapes of hazards or survival functions. Simulation results show that our method outperforms its closest competitor for modeling restricted mean lifetimes in terms of bias and efficiency in both independent censoring and dependent censoring scenarios. Survival estimates of restricted lifetime model parameters and marginal survival estimates regain much of the precision lost due to censoring. The proposed method is also much less subject to dependent censoring bias captured by covariates in the restricted mean model. This particular feature is observed in a full statistical analysis conducted in the context of the International Breast Cancer Study Group Ludwig Trial V using the proposed methodology.",Statistics in medicine,2011,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
21462016,Using routinely collected health data to investigate the association between ethnicity and breast cancer incidence and survival: what is the impact of missing data and multiple ethnicities?,"The aims of this study were to: (1) investigate the relationship between ethnicity and breast cancer incidence and survival using cancer registry and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data; and (2) assess the impact of missing data and the recording of multiple ethnicities for some patients. A total of 48,234 breast cancer patients diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 in two English regions were identified. Ethnicity was missing in 16% of cases. Multiple imputation (10 iterations) of missing ethnicity was undertaken using a range of predictor variables. Multiple ethnicities for a single patient were recorded in 4% of cases. Three methods of assigning ethnicity were used: 'most popular' code, 'last recorded' code, and proportions calculated using all recorded episodes for each patient. Age-standardised incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 5-year survival were calculated before and after imputation for the three methods of assigning ethnicity. Breast cancer incidence was lower in the South Asian group (IRR=0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.69 compared to the White group). In unadjusted analyses, the South Asian group had consistently higher survival compared with the White group (hazard ratio [HR]=0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.95). After adjustment for age and stage, there were no survival differences amongst the White, South Asian and Black groups. Survival was higher in the 'Other' ethnic group when using the 'last recorded' method to assign ethnicity (HR=0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.85 compared with the White group). The results were similar before and after imputation, using all three methods of assigning ethnicity. Breast cancer incidence was lower in the South Asian group than in the White group. After adjusting for casemix there were no consistent survival differences amongst the ethnic groups. Although the impact of missing data and multiple ethnicities was minimal in this study, researchers should always consider these issues, as the results may not be generalisable to other populations and datasets.",Ethnicity & health,2011,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
21266980,Comparison of methods for handling missing data on immunohistochemical markers in survival analysis of breast cancer.,"Tissue micro-arrays (TMAs) are increasingly used to generate data of the molecular phenotype of tumours in clinical epidemiology studies, such as studies of disease prognosis. However, TMA data are particularly prone to missingness. A variety of methods to deal with missing data are available. However, the validity of the various approaches is dependent on the structure of the missing data and there are few empirical studies dealing with missing data from molecular pathology. The purpose of this study was to investigate the results of four commonly used approaches to handling missing data from a large, multi-centre study of the molecular pathological determinants of prognosis in breast cancer. We pooled data from over 11,000 cases of invasive breast cancer from five studies that collected information on seven prognostic indicators together with survival time data. We compared the results of a multi-variate Cox regression using four approaches to handling missing data - complete case analysis (CCA), mean substitution (MS) and multiple imputation without inclusion of the outcome (MI-) and multiple imputation with inclusion of the outcome (MI+). We also performed an analysis in which missing data were simulated under different assumptions and the results of the four methods were compared. Over half the cases had missing data on at least one of the seven variables and 11 percent had missing data on 4 or more. The multi-variate hazard ratio estimates based on multiple imputation models were very similar to those derived after using MS, with similar standard errors. Hazard ratio estimates based on the CCA were only slightly different, but the estimates were less precise as the standard errors were large. However, in data simulated to be missing completely at random (MCAR) or missing at random (MAR), estimates for MI+ were least biased and most accurate, whereas estimates for CCA were most biased and least accurate. In this study, empirical results from analyses using CCA, MS, MI- and MI+ were similar, although results from CCA were less precise.

20881891,Uterine and quality of life changes in postmenopausal women with an asymptomatic tamoxifen-thickened endometrium randomized to continuation of tamoxifen or switching to anastrozole.,"Before the knowledge that 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen is less efficacious than 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen followed by 2 to 3 years of anastrozole/exemestane, we designed a multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial in women taking tamoxifen with a thickened endometrium to compare uterine and quality-of-life parameters between those switching to anastrozole and those continuing tamoxifen. Asymptomatic postmenopausal women who took adjuvant tamoxifen for 2 to 3 years for operable breast cancer with a double endometrial thickness greater than 7 mm were randomized to 20 mg tamoxifen or 1 mg anastrozole for the remaining duration, totaling 5 years. Tablets were unrecognizable for drug assignment. The primary endpoints were the differences in double endometrial thickness and uterine volume after 1 year. Uterine and quality-of-life data were analyzed using regression methods, and missing values were handled using multiple imputation. Seventy-two women (median age, 60 y) were randomized in five hospitals. Relative to women continuing tamoxifen, women switching to anastrozole experienced a decrease of 53% (95% CI, 41%-63%) in double endometrial thickness and a decrease of 51% (95% CI, 39%-60%) in uterine volume. Vaginal dryness (b = 0.064; 95% CI, 0.016-0.112) and sexual problems (b = 0.054; 95% CI, 0.007-0.102) increased in women taking anastrozole compared with women taking tamoxifen. Treatment arms did not differ regarding withdrawal rate and the experience of (serious) adverse events. Despite premature trial closure, our data provided valuable insights. Switching to anastrozole strongly decreased the endometrial thickness and uterine volume but increased sexual disturbances. Safe and effective interventions are needed to alleviate sexual dysfunction.","Menopause (New York, N.Y.)",2011,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
20696630,Investigating reasons for socioeconomic inequalities in breast cancer survival in New Zealand.,"This study investigated the role that demographic and tumour factors play in explaining socioeconomic inequalities in breast cancer survival. Breast cancer cases notified to the New Zealand Cancer Registry (NZCR) from April 2005 to April 2007 were followed up to April 2009. The New Zealand area-based deprivation index (NZDep) was used as a measure of socioeconomic position. Relative survival rates were estimated using sex-, deprivation- and ethnic-specific life tables. Multiple imputation was used to impute missing data. Excess mortality modelling was used to estimate the contribution of demographic and tumour factors to inequalities in survival. There were 2968 breast cancer cases included and 433 recorded deaths. Relative survival rates at 4 years varied across deprivation groups. Using NZDep deciles 1-4 (least deprived) as the reference group, the age- and ethnicity-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for NZDep deciles 7-8 was 2.03 (CI 1.36-3.04) and for NZDep deciles 9-10 was 1.93 (CI 1.28-2.92). In the fully adjusted model there remained 50% excess mortality for the two most deprived groups compared to the most affluent. Variables which measured timely access to care (extent/size) accounted for more of the survival disparity than breast cancer subtype variables (ER/PR/HER2). Women from deprived areas in New Zealand who are diagnosed with breast cancer are less likely to survive as long as those from affluent areas. A substantial proportion of these socioeconomic disparities can be attributed to differential access to health care although other factors, currently unknown, are also likely to play an important role.",Cancer epidemiology,2010,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
20638252,Missing data imputation using statistical and machine learning methods in a real breast cancer problem.,"Missing data imputation is an important task in cases where it is crucial to use all available data and not discard records with missing values. This work evaluates the performance of several statistical and machine learning imputation methods that were used to predict recurrence in patients in an extensive real breast cancer data set. Imputation methods based on statistical techniques, e.g., mean, hot-deck and multiple imputation, and machine learning techniques, e.g., multi-layer perceptron (MLP), self-organisation maps (SOM) and k-nearest neighbour (KNN), were applied to data collected through the ""El Álamo-I"" project, and the results were then compared to those obtained from the listwise deletion (LD) imputation method. The database includes demographic, therapeutic and recurrence-survival information from 3679 women with operable invasive breast cancer diagnosed in 32 different hospitals belonging to the Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group (GEICAM). The accuracies of predictions on early cancer relapse were measured using artificial neural networks (ANNs), in which different ANNs were estimated using the data sets with imputed missing values. The imputation methods based on machine learning algorithms outperformed imputation statistical methods in the prediction of patient outcome. Friedman's test revealed a significant difference (p=0.0091) in the observed area under the ROC curve (AUC) values, and the pairwise comparison test showed that the AUCs for MLP, KNN and SOM were significantly higher (p=0.0053, p=0.0048 and p=0.0071, respectively) than the AUC from the LD-based prognosis model. The methods based on machine learning techniques were the most suited for the imputation of missing values and led to a significant enhancement of prognosis accuracy compared to imputation methods based on statistical procedures.",Artificial intelligence in medicine,2010,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
20516438,Breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in older women: the role of patient preference and interactions with physicians.,"Breast cancer chemotherapy decisions in patients > or = 65 years old (older) are complex because of comorbidity, toxicity, and limited data on patient preference. We examined relationships between preferences and chemotherapy use. Older women (n = 934) diagnosed with invasive (> or = 1 cm), nonmetastatic breast cancer from 2004 to 2008 were recruited from 53 cooperative group sites. Data were collected from patient interviews (87% complete), physician survey (93% complete), and charts. Logistic regression and multiple imputation methods were used to assess associations between chemotherapy and independent variables. Chemotherapy use was also evaluated according to the following two groups: indicated (estrogen receptor [ER] negative and/or node positive) and possibly indicated (ER positive and node negative). Mean patient age was 73 years (range, 65 to 100 years). Unadjusted chemotherapy rates were 69% in the indicated group and 16% in the possibly indicated group. Women who would choose chemotherapy for an increase in survival of < or = 12 months had 3.9 times (95% CI, 2.4 to 6.3 times; P < .001) higher odds of receiving chemotherapy than women with lower preferences, controlling for covariates. Stronger preferences were seen when chemotherapy could be indicated (odds ratio [OR] = 7.7; 95% CI, 3.8 to 16; P < .001) than when treatment might be possibly indicated (OR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.8; P = .06). Higher patient rating of provider communication was also related to chemotherapy use in the possibly indicated group (OR = 1.9 per 5-point increase in communication score; 95% CI, 1.4 to 2.8; P < .001) but not in the indicated group (P = .15). Older women's preferences and communication with providers are important correlates of chemotherapy use, especially when benefits are more equivocal.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2010,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
20461093,Tamoxifen resistance in early breast cancer: statistical modelling of tissue markers to improve risk prediction.,"For over two decades, the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) has been used in the United Kingdom to calculate risk scores and inform management about breast cancer patients. It is derived using just three clinical variables - nodal involvement, tumour size and grade. New scientific methods now make cost-effective measurement of many biological characteristics of tumour tissue from breast cancer biopsy samples possible. However, the number of potential explanatory variables to be considered presents a statistical challenge. The aim of this study was to investigate whether in ER+ tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients, biological variables can add value to NPI predictors, to provide improved prognostic stratification in terms of overall recurrence-free survival (RFS) and also in terms of remaining recurrence free while on tamoxifen treatment (RFoT). A particular goal was to enable the discrimination of patients with a very low risk of recurrence. Tissue samples of 401 cases were analysed by microarray technology, providing biomarker data for 72 variables in total, from AKT, BAD, HER, MTOR, PgR, MAPK and RAS families. Only biomarkers screened as potentially informative (i.e., exhibiting univariate association with recurrence) were offered to the multivariate model. The multiple imputation method was used to deal with missing values, and bootstrap sampling was used to assess internal validity and refine the model. Neither the RFS nor RFoT models derived included Grade, but both had better predictive and discrimination ability than NPI. A slight difference was observed between models in terms of biomarkers included, and, in particular, the RFoT model alone included HER2. The estimated 7-year RFS rates in the lowest-risk groups by RFS and RFoT models were 95 and 97%, respectively, whereas the corresponding rate for the lowest-risk group of NPI was 89%. The findings demonstrate considerable potential for improved prognostic modelling by incorporation of biological variables into risk prediction. In particular, the ability to identify a low-risk group with minimal risk of recurrence is likely to have clinical appeal. With larger data sets and longer follow-up, this modelling approach has the potential to enhance an understanding of the interplay of biological characteristics, treatment and cancer recurrence.",British journal of cancer,2010,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
20085642,Comparison of techniques for handling missing covariate data within prognostic modelling studies: a simulation study.,"There is no consensus on the most appropriate approach to handle missing covariate data within prognostic modelling studies. Therefore a simulation study was performed to assess the effects of different missing data techniques on the performance of a prognostic model. Datasets were generated to resemble the skewed distributions seen in a motivating breast cancer example. Multivariate missing data were imposed on four covariates using four different mechanisms; missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), missing not at random (MNAR) and a combination of all three mechanisms. Five amounts of incomplete cases from 5% to 75% were considered. Complete case analysis (CC), single imputation (SI) and five multiple imputation (MI) techniques available within the R statistical software were investigated: a) data augmentation (DA) approach assuming a multivariate normal distribution, b) DA assuming a general location model, c) regression switching imputation, d) regression switching with predictive mean matching (MICE-PMM) and e) flexible additive imputation models. A Cox proportional hazards model was fitted and appropriate estimates for the regression coefficients and model performance measures were obtained. Performing a CC analysis produced unbiased regression estimates, but inflated standard errors, which affected the significance of the covariates in the model with 25% or more missingness. Using SI, underestimated the variability; resulting in poor coverage even with 10% missingness. Of the MI approaches, applying MICE-PMM produced, in general, the least biased estimates and better coverage for the incomplete covariates and better model performance for all mechanisms. However, this MI approach still produced biased regression coefficient estimates for the incomplete skewed continuous covariates when 50% or more cases had missing data imposed with a MCAR, MAR or combined mechanism. When the missingness depended on the incomplete covariates, i.e. MNAR, estimates were biased with more than 10% incomplete cases for all MI approaches. The results from this simulation study suggest that performing MICE-PMM may be the preferred MI approach provided that less than 50% of the cases have missing data and the missing data are not MNAR.",BMC medical research methodology,2010,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
19760037,Polymorphisms in the UBC9 and PIAS3 genes of the SUMO-conjugating system and breast cancer risk.,"SUMOylation consists in the covalent conjugation of small ubiquitin-related modifiers to target proteins. SUMOylation participates in processes that are tightly linked to tumorigenesis, and genetic variability in the SUMO-conjugating system may influence the development of breast cancer. We recently reported that variation in the UBC9 gene encoding the SUMO-conjugating enzyme may affect the grade of breast tumors. Following comprehensive in silico analyses for detection of putative functional polymorphisms in 14 genes of the SUMO system, we selected one coding SNP in PIAS3 and seven tag SNPs in UBC9 for association analyses. Results were based on 1,021 cases, and 1,015 matched controls from the population-based GENICA study. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by conditional logistic regression. To explore the association with polymorphisms closely linked to the genotyped variants, multiple imputation based on HapMap data was applied. The study revealed associations of four UBC9 polymorphisms with risk of grade 1 tumors. Comparison of genotype and haplotype models indicated that the best representation of risk solely relied on rs7187167 under dominant penetrance. Women carrying the rare allele showed an increased risk of grade 1 tumors compared with common homozygotes (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.18-2.95). This effect appeared to be stronger in women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Imputation of polymorphisms in a 300-kb region around the genotyped polymorphisms identified no variants with stronger associations. Our findings suggest that genetic variation in UBC9 may affect the risk of grade 1 breast tumors.",Breast cancer research and treatment,2010,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
19358266,Common variants in the UBC9 gene encoding the SUMO-conjugating enzyme are associated with breast tumor grade.,"UBC9 encodes a protein that conjugates small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) to target proteins resulting in a change of their localization, activity or stability. Genetic variability may affect expression and activity of UBC9 and may have an impact on breast tumor progression. We investigated associations between UBC9 genotypes and histopathological parameters in 1,021 breast cancer cases of the GENICA collection using a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) tagging approach. Genotyping analyses were performed by TaqMan(R) allelic discrimination. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by ordinal logistic regression. Multiple imputation based on HapMap data was applied to boost the power of the study. The study revealed significant associations of three UBC9 SNPs with histological grade (rs7187167, p(trend) = 0.001; rs11248866, p(trend) = 0.009; rs8052688, p(trend) = 0.008). Model selection identified a recessive penetrance model for rs7187167 as the best representation of tumor grade (global p = 0.001). This model did not improve by inclusion of additional SNPs in linkage disequilibrium. Imputation of SNPs in a 300 kb region around the genotyped SNPs supported rs7187167 as a major contributor to tumor grade. Compared with common allele carriers, rare homozygotes presented less frequently with high grade tumors (G3 vs. G1: OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11-0.62; G3 vs. G2: OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.23-0.86). In addition to tumor size, nodal status and estrogen receptor status, multivariate analyses confirmed an independent role of rs7187167 as predictor of tumor grade (p = 0.0003). The present results underline the value of genetic variation in UBC9 for breast cancer prognosis.",International journal of cancer,2009,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
19352457,Quantitative assessment of tissue biomarkers and construction of a model to predict outcome in breast cancer using multiple imputation.,"Missing data pose one of the greatest challenges in the rigorous evaluation of biomarkers. The limited availability of specimens with complete clinical annotation and quality biomaterial often leads to underpowered studies. Tissue microarray studies, for example, may be further handicapped by the loss of data points because of unevaluable staining, core loss, or the lack of tumor in the histospot. This paper presents a novel approach to these common problems in the context of a tissue protein biomarker analysis in a cohort of patients with breast cancer. Our analysis develops techniques based on multiple imputation to address the missing value problem. We first select markers using a training cohort, identifying a small subset of protein expression levels that are most useful in predicting patient survival. The best model is obtained by including both protein markers (including COX6C, GATA3, NAT1, and ESR1) and lymph node status. The use of either lymph node status or the four protein expression levels provides similar improvements in goodness-of-fit, with both significantly better than a baseline clinical model. Using the same multiple imputation strategy, we then validate the results out-of-sample on a larger independent cohort. Our approach of integrating multiple imputation with each stage of the analysis serves as an example that may be replicated or adapted in future studies with missing values.",Cancer informatics,2009,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
18598349,Risk prediction models with incomplete data with application to prediction of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer: prospective data from the Nurses' Health Study.,"A number of breast cancer risk prediction models have been developed to provide insight into a woman's individual breast cancer risk. Although circulating levels of estradiol in postmenopausal women predict subsequent breast cancer risk, whether the addition of estradiol levels adds significantly to a model's predictive power has not previously been evaluated. Using linear regression, the authors developed an imputed estradiol score using measured estradiol levels (the outcome) and both case status and risk factor data (for example, body mass index) from a nested case-control study conducted within a large prospective cohort study and used multiple imputation methods to develop an overall risk model including both risk factor data from the main cohort and estradiol levels from the nested case-control study. The authors evaluated the addition of imputed estradiol level to the previously published Rosner and Colditz log-incidence model for breast cancer risk prediction within the larger Nurses' Health Study cohort. The follow-up was from 1980 to 2000; during this time, 1,559 invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cases were confirmed. The addition of imputed estradiol levels significantly improved risk prediction; the age-specific concordance statistic increased from 0.635 +/- 0.007 to 0.645 +/- 0.007 (P < 0.001) after the addition of imputed estradiol. Circulating estradiol levels in postmenopausal women appear to add to other lifestyle factors in predicting a woman's individual risk of breast cancer.",Breast cancer research : BCR,2008,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
18254128,A generalized log-rank test for interval-censored failure time data via multiple imputation.,"Interval-censored (IC) failure time data often occur in follow-up studies where subjects can only be followed periodically and the failure time can only be known to lie in an interval. In this paper we propose a modified log-rank test for the problem of comparing two or more IC samples. Our log-rank statistic and covariance matrix are calculated by a multiple imputation technique. Through simulation studies, we find that the performance of the proposed test is comparable to that of the test proposed by Finkelstein (Biometrics 1986; 42(4):845-854) and is better than that of the two existing log-rank type tests proposed by Sun (Lifetime Data Anal. 2001; 7:363-375) and Zhao and Sun (Stat. Med. 2004; 23(10):1621-1629) due to the differences in the method of multiple imputation and the covariance matrix estimation. Our covariance matrix estimator is similar to the estimator used by Follmann et al. (Biometrics 2003; 59:420-429) for clustered data. The proposed method is illustrated by means of an example involving patients with breast cancer.",Statistics in medicine,2008,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
17389089,A comparison of different methods for including 'age at menopause' in analyses of the association between hormone replacement therapy use and breast cancer.,"Late 'age at menopause' is a recognised risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer and is also associated with decreased use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). When investigating the association between HRT use and breast cancer risk it is therefore necessary to adjust for the potential confounder, 'age at menopause'. 'Age at menopause', however, cannot be determined for women with a hysterectomy and ovarian conservation. Using data on 13 357 postmenopausal women in whom 396 cases of invasive breast cancer were diagnosed during 9 years of follow-up from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, we compared the estimates of relative risk of HRT use for breast cancer for three different methods of dealing with missing data: complete-case analysis, single imputation and multiple imputation. 'Age at menopause' was missing for 17% of the data. Both HRT use and 'age at menopause' were significant risk factors for breast cancer, although 'age at menopause' only marginally confounded the estimates of risk for HRT. Women with 'age at menopause' missing did not represent a random sample of the population. Complete-case analyses resulted in higher estimates of the risk associated with HRT use compared with the different methods of imputation. We recommend that analyses investigating the association between HRT and breast cancer should present the results in two ways: excluding women with 'age at menopause' missing and including the women using multiple imputation. For both methods, estimates of risk, with and without the adjustment of 'age at menopause', should be given.",The journal of family planning and reproductive health care,2007,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
15900587,Estimating the proportion of cured patients in a censored sample.,"There has been a recurring interest in modelling survival data which hypothesize subpopulations of individuals highly susceptible to some types of adverse events while other individuals are assumed to be at much less risk, like recurrence of breast cancer. A binary random effect is assumed in this article to model the susceptibility of each individual. We propose a simple multiple imputation algorithm for the analysis of censored data which combines a binary regression formulation for the probability of occurrence of an event, say recurrence of the breast cancer tumour, and a Cox's proportional hazards regression model for the time to occurrence of the event if it does. The model distinguishes the effects of the covariates on the probability of cure and on the time to recurrence of the disease. A SAS macro has been written to implement the proposed multiple imputation algorithm so that sophisticated programming effort can be rendered into a user-friendly application. Simulation results show that the estimates are reasonably efficient. The method is applied to analyse the breast cancer recurrence data. The proposed method can be modified easily to accommodate more general random effects other than the binary random effects so that the random effects not only affect the probability of occurrence of the event, but also the heterogeneity of the time to recurrence of the event among the uncured patients.",Statistics in medicine,2005,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"

11764260,Multiple imputation methods for estimating regression coefficients in the competing risks model with missing cause of failure.,"We propose a method to estimate the regression coefficients in a competing risks model where the cause-specific hazard for the cause of interest is related to covariates through a proportional hazards relationship and when cause of failure is missing for some individuals. We use multiple imputation procedures to impute missing cause of failure, where the probability that a missing cause is the cause of interest may depend on auxiliary covariates, and combine the maximum partial likelihood estimators computed from several imputed data sets into an estimator that is consistent and asymptotically normal. A consistent estimator for the asymptotic variance is also derived. Simulation results suggest the relevance of the theory in finite samples.

11129472,Semiparametric regression analysis of interval-censored data.,"We propose a semiparametric approach to the proportional hazards regression analysis of interval-censored data. An EM algorithm based on an approximate likelihood leads to an M-step that involves maximizing a standard Cox partial likelihood to estimate regression coefficients and then using the Breslow estimator for the unknown baseline hazards. The E-step takes a particularly simple form because all incomplete data appear as linear terms in the complete-data log likelihood. The algorithm of Turnbull (1976, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 38, 290-295) is used to determine times at which the hazard can take positive mass. We found multiple imputation to yield an easily computed variance estimate that appears to be more reliable than asymptotic methods with small to moderately sized data sets. In the right-censored survival setting, the approach reduces to the standard Cox proportional hazards analysis, while the algorithm reduces to the one suggested by Clayton and Cuzick (1985, Applied Statistics 34, 148-156). The method is illustrated on data from the breast cancer cosmetics trial, previously analyzed by Finkelstein (1986, Biometrics 42, 845-854) and several subsequent authors.",Biometrics,2000,"(""breast cancer""[Title/Abstract]) AND (""multiple imputation""[Title/Abstract])"
